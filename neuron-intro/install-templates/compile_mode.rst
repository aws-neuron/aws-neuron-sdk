If model compilation occurs outside the model deployment environment, you can 
install only the Neuron framework extensions and the compiler on any compute 
instance. This setup is helpful when compiling large complex models that require 
large amount of memory or during a CICD process where models are compiled in a 
separate step, prior to deployment.
