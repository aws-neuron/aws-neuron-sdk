In this section, you'll find resources to help you use containers for accelerating your deep learning models on Inferentia and Trainium instances.

Getting started with Neuron DLC using Docker
--------------------------------------------
AWS Neuron Deep Learning Containers (DLCs) are a set of Docker images for training and serving models on AWS Trainium and Inferentia instances using AWS Neuron SDK. To build a Neuron container using Docker, please refer to :ref:`containers-getting-started`.

Neuron Deep Learning Containers
-------------------------------
In most cases, it is recommended to use a preconfigured `Deep Learning Container (DLC) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/deep-learning-containers/latest/devguide/what-is-dlc.html>`_ from AWS. Each DLC is pre-configured to have all of the Neuron components installed and is specific to the chosen ML Framework. For more details on Neuron Deep Learning Containers, please refer to :ref:`locate-neuron-dlc-image`.

Customize Neuron DLC
---------------------
Neuron DLC can be customized as needed. To learn more about how to customize  the Neuron Deep Learning Container (DLC) to fit your specific project needs, please refer to :ref:`containers-dlc-then-customize-devflow`.

Neuron Plugins for Containerized Environments
---------------------------------------------
Neuron provides plugins for better observability and fault tolerance. For more information on the plugins, please refer to :ref:`neuron-container-plugins`.
