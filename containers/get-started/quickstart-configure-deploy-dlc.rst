Quickstart: Configure and deploy a Deep Learning Container (DLC) with AWS Neuron SDK
====================================================================================

This topic guides you through configuring and deploying a Deep Learning Container (DLC) using the AWS Neuron SDK. When you have completed it, you will understand the basic process to prepare and deploy a DLC that runs on AWS Trainium and Inferentia ML chipsets.

Overview
--------

.. {Describe exactly what the customer will achieve by following the tutorial, including information on when they will use the process in this doc and a high-level review of the steps in it. This helps them quickly assess the relevance of the tutorial to their own use case.}

----------------

This tutorial assumes that you have experience in the following areas:

* {list required knowledge or experience, provide links to supporting topics/info if appropriate}
* ...

Prerequisites
-------------

.. {What the customer must have available in terms of hardware, software, accounts/permissions, and knowledge/skills. Provide links where appropriate.}
* {Required packages/services/tools/hardware with the supported versions, if any}
* {Account and auth requirements, if any}
* {System requirements, if any}
* {Required knowledge/skills, if appropriate}
* {Any other prerequisites that the customer must have in place before starting the tutorial}

Prepare your environment
----------------------

.. {Optional section, where you provide any initial preparation or configuration the customer must perform, such as setting up a virtual environment, configuring environment variables, downloading a dockerfile template, etc. Basically, anything the customer must have in place and configured before starting into the steps below.

In this step, you will {describe the outcome of the task described in this step}.

.. {The first discrete task in the end-to-end process covered by the tutorial. Use active voice (“You do X”, not “X is done by you”) as best you can. Provide code, shell commands, or screenshots, that will make the subtask clear or easy whenever possible — never make the customer guess as to the specifics of the action you’re asking them to take.}
First, you ...

.. {Optionally, provide some way for the user to confirm they were successful in performing the task, such as code or shell output, or running some command that let’s them confirm they did everything correctly as instructed.}
Step 2: {scoped task starting with a verb}
------------------------------

In this step, you will {describe the outcome of the task described in this step based on the work they did in the prior step}.

.. {The next discrete task in the process covered by the tutorial. Use active voice (“You do X”, not “X is done by you”) as best you can.

.. **{More steps as needed, following the same pattern as above. Each step should be a discrete task that builds on the previous steps, leading to the final outcome of the tutorial.}**
Step N: {scoped task starting with a verb}
-----------------------------

In the final step, you will {describe the outcome of the task described in this step based on the work they did in the prior step}.

.. {The last discrete task in the process covered by the tutorial. Use active voice (“You do X”, not “X is done by you”) as best you can. Provide code, shell commands, or screenshots, that will make the subtask clear or easy whenever possible — never make the customer guess as to the specifics of the action you’re asking them to take.}
You ...

All complete! Now, let’s confirm everything works.

Confirmation
