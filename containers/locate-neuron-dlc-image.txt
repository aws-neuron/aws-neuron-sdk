    .. tab-item:: Introduction

        The Pytorch Neuron DLC images are published to ECR Public, which is the recommended URL to use for most cases. If you are working within AWS SageMaker, you should use the Amazon ECR URL instead of the Amazon ECR Public one because of the restriction of Sagemaker. TensorFlow DLCs are not updated with the latest release. For earlier releases please check `here <https://github.com/aws/deep-learning-containers/blob/master/available_images.md#neuron-containers>`_.
