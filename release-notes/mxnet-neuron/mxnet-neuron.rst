^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Date: 11/05/2021

* Updated Neuron Runtime (which is integrated within this package) to ``libnrt 2.2.18.0`` to fix a container issue that was preventing

        -  You must update to the latest Neuron Driver (``aws-neuron-dkms`` version 2.1 or newer) 
           for proper functionality of the new runtime library.
        -  Read :ref:`introduce-libnrt`
           application note that describes :ref:`why are we making this

Summary
-------

This release includes the bug fix for MXNet Model Server not being able to clean up
Neuron RTD states after model is unloaded (deleted) from model server.

Resolved Issues
---------------

-  Issue: MXNet Model Server is not able to clean up Neuron RTD states
   after model is unloaded (deleted) from model server.

    -  Workaround for earlier versions: run “\ ``/opt/aws/neuron/bin/neuron-cli reset``\ “ to
   clear Neuron RTD states after all models are unloaded and server is
   shut down.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Date 09/22/2020

Various minor improvements.

Major New Features
------------------

Resolved Issues

   14] Bad address" during subprocess call (see
   https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/13875 for more
   details). This issue is fixed with a mitigation patch from MXNet for
   Open-MP fork race conditions.

   -  Workaround for earlier versions: Export KMP_INIT_AT_FORK=false
      before running python process.

   transfer if shared-memory cannot be allocated by Neuron-Runtime

.. _resolved-issues-5:

Resolved Issues
---------------

-  User is unable to allocate Neuron-Runtime shared-memory resource when
   using MXNet-Neuron in a container to communicate with Neuron-Runtime
   in another container. This is resolved by automatic falling back to

Resolved Issues
---------------

-  The following issue is resolved when the latest multi-model-server
   with version >= 1.1.0 is used with MXNet-Neuron. You would still need
   to use "``/opt/aws/neuron/bin/neuron-cli reset``" to clear all Neuron
   RTD states after multi-model-server is exited:

   -  Issue: MXNet Model Server is not able to clean up Neuron RTD
      states after model is unloaded (deleted) from model server and
      previous workaround "``/opt/aws/neuron/bin/neuron-cli reset``" is
      unable to clear all Neuron RTD states.

.. _known-issues-and-limitations-4:

Known Issues and Limitations
----------------------------

-  Latest pip version 20.0.1 breaks installation of MXNet-Neuron pip
   wheel which has py2.py3 in the wheel name. This breaks all existing
   released versions. The error looks like:

::

   Looking in indexes: https://pypi.org/simple, https://pip.repos.neuron.amazonaws.com
   ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement mxnet-neuron (from versions: none)
   ERROR: No matching distribution found for mxnet-neuron

-  Work around: install the older version of pip using "pip install
   pip==19.3.1".

-  Issue: Compiler flags cannot be passed to compiler during compile

   compile call using “flags” option followed by a list of flags.

-  Issue: Advanced CPU fallback option is a way to attempt to improve
   the number of operators on Inferentia. The default is currently set
   to on, which may cause failures. The fix: This option is now off by
   default.

Known issues and limitations
----------------------------

-  Issue: Compiler flags cannot be passed to compiler during compile
   call.

-  Issue: Advanced CPU fallback option is a way to attempt to improve
   the number of operators on Inferentia. The default is currently set
   to on, which may cause failures.

   -  Workaround: explicitly turn it off by setting compile option
      op_by_op_compiler_retry to 0.

-  Issue: Temporary files are put in current directory when debug is
   enabled.

   -  Workaround: create a separate work directory and run the process
      from within the work directory

-  Issue: MXNet Model Server is not able to clean up Neuron RTD states
   after model is unloaded (deleted) from model server.

   -  Workaround: run “\ ``/opt/aws/neuron/bin/neuron-cli reset``\ “ to
      clear Neuron RTD states after all models are unloaded and server
      is shut down.

-  Issue: MXNet 1.5.1 may return inconsistent node names for some
   operators when they are the primary outputs of a Neuron subgraph.
   This causes failures during inference.

   -  Workaround : Use the ``excl_node_names`` compilation option to
      change the partitioning of the graph during compile so that these
      nodes are not the primary output of a neuron subgraph. See
      :ref:`ref-mxnet-neuron-compilation-python-api`

   .. code:: python

      compile_args = { 'excl_node_names': ["node_name_to_exclude"] }

Models Supported
----------------

The following models have successfully run on neuron-inferentia systems

1. Resnet50 V1/V2
2. Inception-V2/V3/V4
3. Parallel-WaveNet
4. Tacotron 2
5. WaveRNN
