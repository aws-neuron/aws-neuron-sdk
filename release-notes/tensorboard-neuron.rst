Known Issues and Limitations - Updated 5/28/2021
================================================

The following are not limitations in the Neuron plugin, but may affect your ability to
use TensorBoard.

- In the DLAMI TensorFlow-Neuron Conda environment, attempting to run ``tensorboard``
  with the existing version of tensorboard will fail.  Please update the tensorboard
  version before installing the Neuron plugin by running ``pip install tensorboard --force-reinstall``.

Neuron Plugin for TensorBoard release [2.2.0.0]
===============================================

Date: 10/27/2021

New in this release
-------------------

   -  Neuron Plugin for TensorBoard now support applications built with Neuron Runtime 2.x (``libnrt.so``).

      .. important::

        -  You must update to the latest Neuron Driver (``aws-neuron-dkms`` version 2.1 or newer) 
           for proper functionality of the new runtime library.
        -  Read :ref:`introduce-libnrt`
           application note that describes :ref:`why are we making this
           change <introduce-libnrt-why>` and
           how :ref:`this change will affect the Neuron
           SDK <introduce-libnrt-how-sdk>` in detail.
        -  Read :ref:`neuron-migrating-apps-neuron-to-libnrt` for detailed information of how to
           migrate your application.

Resolved Issues
---------------

N/A - first release

.. _known-issues--limits-1:

Known Issues & Limits
---------------------

-  Must install TensorBoard-Neuron by itself, or after regular
   TensorBoard is installed. If regular Tensorboard is installed after
   TensorBoard-Neuron, it may overwrite some needed files.
-  Utilization missing in Op Profile due to missing FLOPs calculation
   (see overview page instead)
-  Neuron Profile plugin may not immediately show up on launch (try
   reloading the page)
-  Graphs with NeuronOps may take a long time to load due to attribute
   size
-  Instructions that cannot be matched to a framework layer/operator
   name show as “” (blank)
-  CPU Usage section in chrome-trace is not applicable
-  Debugger currently supports TensorFlow only
-  Visualization requires a TensorFlow-compatible graph
