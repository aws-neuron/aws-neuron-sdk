# Neuron Compiler Release Notes

This document lists the release notes for AWS Neuron compiler. The Neuron Compiler is an ahead-of-time compiler that ensures Neuron will optimally utilize the Inferentia chips.

Operator-support for each input format is provided directly from the compiler.

```
neuron-cc list-operators --framework {TENSORFLOW | MXNET | ONNX}
```

The supported operators are also listed here:
* [Neuron-cc TensorFlow Operators](./neuron-cc-ops/neuron-cc-ops-tensorflow.md)
* [Neuron-cc PyTorch Operators](./neuron-cc-ops/neuron-cc-ops-pytorch.md)
* [Neuron-cc MXNet Operators](./neuron-cc-ops/neuron-cc-ops-mxnet.md)
* [Neuron-cc ONNX Operators](./neuron-cc-ops/neuron-cc-ops-onnx.md)

## Known issues and limitations - updated 11/17/2020

1. **Control flow** Neuron only supports control flow operators which are static at compile time. For example static length RNN, top-k, sort.
2. **Data layout**  The Neuron compiler supports multiple data layout format (NCHW, NHWC, ...). Non-CNHW input/output data-layouts will require Neuron to insert additional _*transpose*_ operations, causing a degradation in performance.
3. **Object detection models** SSD-300, YOLO v3, YOLO v4 are supported. More support is coming in future releases for RCNN-based models.
4. **Primary inputs in NeuronCore Pipeline mode** When a neural network is executed in NeuronCore Pipeline mode, only the first operator in a neural network can receive primary inputs from the host.
7. **Reduce data type** INT8 data type is not currently supported by the Neuron compiler.
8. **ONNX support** Support for ONNX models is limited. If generated from other frameworks then please use the native model directly.
9. **NeuronCore Pipeline:** NeuronCorePipeline mode provides low-latency and high-throughput for small batch sizes. We recommend to start testing with batch=1 and gradually increase batch size to fine tune your model throughput and latency performance. Currently there is a known issue with a compiler crash on batch size 32 using BERT-Base, sequence length=128, --neuroncore-pipeline-cores = 16, but this is not the optimal setting for that model.

# [1.0.24045.0]

Date 11/17/2020

## Summary

Improved performance for pipelined execution (NeuronCore Pipeline). 

## Major New Features

* NeuronCore Pipeline: improved partitioning to enable better static weights loading to cache.


## Resolved Issues

* --static-weights : No longer needed. As this is shown in some examples, please remove the option since the compiler now performs this auto-detection by default.

* --num-neuroncores renamed to --neuroncore-pipeline-cores. The prior option form is still functional (backwards compatible) and will be removed in future releases.

* --batching_en: Resolved compilation failure of ResNet50 FP32 batch 1 on Ubuntu16 when "--batching_en" was used. 

# [1.0.20600.0]

Date 9/22/2020

## Summary

Various performance improvements - both compilation time and inference speed of object recognition models. 
* Compiler optimization '-O2' option is now enabled by default.

## Major New Features

* Improved inference performance of YOLO v3, YOLO v4, VGG16, SSD300. BERT models were improved by an additional 10%.

* Modifed such that -O2 is now the default behavior and does not need to be specified. Note: some tutorials still explicitly specify "-O2". These will be modified in forthcoming updates.

## Resolved Issues

* Sped up compilation of large models that were taking hours to sub-40 minute.



# [1.0.18001.0]

Date 8/08/2020

# [1.0.6801.0]

Date 1/27/2020

## Summary

Bug fixes and some performance enhancement related to data movement for BERT-type neural networks.

## Major New Features

None

## Resolved Issues

* Improved throughput for operators processed in the Neuron Runtime CPU. As an example: execution of 4 single NeuronCore NEFF models of ResNet50 v2 float16 batch = 5 in parallel on an inf1.1xlarge sped up by 30%.
* Corrected shape handling in Gather(TensorFlow)/Take(MXNet) operators that are processed by the Neuron Runtime in the Neuron Runtime vCPU, which resolves a possible crash in Neuron Compiler when compiling models with these operators with some shapes.
* Added support for TensorFlow *OneHot* operator (as a Neuron Runtime CPU operator).
* Added more internal checking for compiler correctness with newly defined error messages for this case.
```
      “Internal ERROR: Data race between Op1 'Name1(...) [...]' and Op2 'Name2(...) [...]'”
```
* Fixed out-of-memory issue introduced in 1.0.5939.0 such that some large models (BERT) compiled on instances with insufficient host memory would cause the runtime to crash with an invalid NEFF. This is actually a compiler error, but due to additional script layers wrapping this in the [BERT demo](../src/examples/tensorflow/bert_demo/README.md), this would have likely been seen as a runtime error like this:

```bash
2020-01-09 13:40:26.002594: E tensorflow/core/framework/op_segment.cc:54] Create kernel failed: Invalid argument: neff is invalid
2020-01-09 13:40:26.002637: E tensorflow/core/common_runtime/executor.cc:642] Executor failed to create kernel. Invalid argument: neff is invalid
[[{{node bert/NeuronOp}}]]
```

## Known issues and limitations

See previous release notes. Some tutorials show use of specific compiler options and flags, these are needed to help provide guidance to the compiler to achieve best performance in specific cases. Please do not use in cases other than as shown in the specific tutorial as results may not be defined. These options should be considered experimental and will be removed over time.

# [1.0.4680.0]

Date:  11/25/2019

## Major new features

N/A, this is the first release.

## Resolved issues

N/A, this is the first release.

## Known issues and limitations

1. **Control flow** Inferentia has a limited support for control flow. In general, Neuron can only support control flow operators which are static at compile time, i.e. static length RNN, top-k, sort, ...
2. **Size of neural network** The size of neural network is influenced by a) type of neural network (CNN, LSTM, MLP) , b) number of layers, c) sizes of input (dimension of the tensors, batch size, ...). The current Neuron compiler release has a limitation in terms of the size of neural network it could effectively optimize. As a result, we limit CNN models (e.g. ResNet) to have an input size of up to 480x480 FP16, batch size of 4; LSTM models (e.g. GNMT) are limited to a time step limit of up to 900; MLP models (like BERT) are limited up to sequence-length equal 128, batch=8.
3. **Data layout**  The Neuron compiler supports multiple data layout format (NCHW, NHWC, ...). Non-CNHW input/output data-layouts will require Neuron to insert additional _*transpose*_ operations, causing a degradation in performance.
4. **Object detection models** Computer-vision object detection and segmentation models are not supported by the current release.
5. **Reduce data type** INT8 data type is not currently supported by the Neuron compiler.
6. **Tensor residency** When a sub-graph that is executed on the host is communicating with a sub-graph that is executing on Neuron cores, tensors are copied via the communication queues between the host and Inferentia memory for each inference, which may result in end-to-end performance degradation.
7. **Primary inputs in NeuronCore Pipeline mode** When a neural network is executed in NeuronCore Pipeline mode, only the first operator in a neural network can receive primary inputs from the host.
