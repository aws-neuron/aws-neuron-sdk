Known Issues and Limitations - updated 08/12/2021
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Support on serialized TensorFlow 2.x custom operators is currently limited. Serializing some operators registered from tensorflow-text through `TensorFlow Hub <https://tfhub.dev/>`_ is going to cause failure in tensorflow.neuron.trace.


-  Issue: When compiling large models, user might run out of memory and
   encounter this fatal error.

::

   terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::bad_alloc'

Solution: run compilation on a c5.4xlarge instance type or larger.

-  Issue: When upgrading ``tensorflow-neuron`` with
   ``pip install tensorflow-neuron --upgrade``, the following error
   message may appear, which is caused by ``pip`` version being too low.

::

     Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement tensorflow<1.16.0,>=1.15.0 (from tensorflow-neuron)

Solution: run a ``pip install pip --upgrade`` before upgrading
``tensorflow-neuron``.

-  Issue: Some Keras routines throws the following error:

::

   AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'decode'.

Solution: Please downgrade `h5py` by `pip install 'h5py<3'`. This is caused by https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/44467.



Tensorflow-Neuron 1.x release [2.0.4.0]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Date: 11/05/2021

* Updated Neuron Runtime (which is integrated within this package) to ``libnrt 2.2.18.0`` to fix a container issue that was preventing 
  the use of containers when /dev/neuron0 was not present. See details here :ref:`neuron-runtime-release-notes`.


Tensorflow-Neuron 1.x release [2.0.3.0]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Date: 10/27/2021

New in this release
-------------------

* TensorFlow Neuron 1.x now support Neuron Runtime 2.x (``libnrt.so`` shared library) only.

     .. important::

        -  You must update to the latest Neuron Driver (``aws-neuron-dkms`` version 2.1 or newer) 
           for proper functionality of the new runtime library.
        -  Read :ref:`introduce-libnrt`
           application note that describes :ref:`why are we making this
           change <introduce-libnrt-why>` and
           how :ref:`this change will affect the Neuron
           SDK <introduce-libnrt-how-sdk>` in detail.
        -  Read :ref:`neuron-migrating-apps-neuron-to-libnrt` for detailed information of how to
           migrate your application.

Resolved Issues
---------------

* Fix neuron-cc argument handling bug when nothing can be compiled.
* Fixing the support of cast operators applied after constants, by Introducing support of constant-folding pass before Neuron auto-mixed-precision.

.. _11551510:

[1.15.5.1.5.1.0]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Date: 07/02/2021

New in this release
-------------------

* Bug fixes regarding scalar inputs/outputs.
* Minor performance improvements when dynamic batch size is turned on or when model is small.

Date: 05/28/2021

New in this release
-------------------

* Reduce the amount of input/output data movement during inference.
* Improve parallelism for dynamic batch size inference by adopting a new sharding mechanism.
* Reduce the amount of host memory usage during inference.
* tfn.saved_model.compile now generates correct code when operator Split is used as output.
* tfn.saved_model.compile now properly reads input tensor shape information from SignatureDef proto.
* tfn.saved_model.compile now terminates properly when neuron-cc compiler argument is passed but there is no successful compilation.

* Other minor bug fixes.

.. _11551330:

[1.15.5.1.3.3.0]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

New in this release
-------------------

1. Minor enhancements.

.. _11551290:

[1.15.5.1.2.9.0]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Date: 03/04/2021

New in this release
-------------------

1. Minor enhancements.


.. _11551280:

[1.15.5.1.2.8.0]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Date: 02/24/2021

New in this release
-------------------

1. Fix for CVE-2021-3177.


.. _11551220:

[1.15.5.1.2.2.0]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Date: 01/30/2021

New in this release
-------------------

1. Bug fixes and internal refactor.

2. Bump tensorflow base package version to 1.15.5.

3. Introduced a new argument ``convert_constants_to_variables`` to the compilation API ``tfn.saved_model.compile``. Setting it to ``True`` can address the issue of large constants consuming too much memory in the tensorflow runtime.




.. _11541130:

[1.15.4.1.1.3.0]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Date: 12/23/2020

New in this release
-------------------

1. Improved logging during `tfn.saved_model.compile` to display `neuron-cc` compilation progress.

2. Small performance improvement in some edge cases by optimizing the NeuronCore-executable assignment mechanism.




.. _11541021680:

[1.15.4.1.0.2168.0]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Date: 11/17/2020

New in this release
-------------------

1. tensorflow-neuron is now a plugin package that can be used together
   with tensorflow~=1.15.0 built with ``GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0``.

2. Improved logging during ``tfn.saved_model.compile`` to display
   ``neuron-cc`` logging file path, which is useful for tracking
   ``neuron-cc`` compilation progress.

3. Small performance improvement by utilizing shared memory more
   efficiently.


.. _11531020430:

[1.15.3.1.0.2043.0]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Date: 09/22/2020

New in this release
-------------------

1. tensorflow-neuron now automatically enables data parallel mode on
   four cores in one Inferentia. In ``tensorflow-model-server-neuron``,
   most models can now fully utilize four cores automatically. In Python
   tensorflow, running threaded inference using ``>=4`` Python threads
   in the same tensorflow Session lead to full utilization of four
   cores.

2. tensorflow-neuron now tries to enable dynamic batch size
   automatically for a limited number of models, such as ResNet50.

3. Improved logging during ``tfn.saved_model.compile`` to display
   input/output information about subgraphs that are going to be
   compiled by ``neuron-cc``.

-  The pip package ``wrapt`` may have a conflicting version in some
   installations. This is seen when this error occurs:

.. code:: bash

   ERROR: Cannot uninstall 'wrapt'. It is a distutils installed project and thus we cannot accurately determine which files belong to it which would lead to only a partial uninstall.

To solve this, you can update wrapt to the newer version:

.. code:: bash

   python3 -m pip install wrapt --ignore-installed
   python3 -m pip install tensorflow-neuron

Within a Conda environment:

.. code:: bash

   conda update wrapt
   conda update tensorflow-neuron
