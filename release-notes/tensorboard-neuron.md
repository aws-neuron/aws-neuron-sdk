## Known Issues & Limits

* Must install TensorBoard-Neuron by itself, or after regular TensorBoard is installed. If regular Tensorboard is installed after TensorBoard-Neuron, it may overwrite some needed files.
* Utilization missing in Op Profile due to missing FLOPs calculation (see overview page instead)
* Neuron Profile plugin may not immediately show up on launch (try reloading the page)
* Graphs with NeuronOps may take a long time to load due to attribute size
* Instructions that cannot be matched to a framework layer/operator name show as “” (blank)
* CPU Usage section in chrome-trace is not applicable
* Debugger currently supports TensorFlow only
* Visualization requires a TensorFlow-compatible graph
