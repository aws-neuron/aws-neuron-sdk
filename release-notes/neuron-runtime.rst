NEFF Support Table:
-------------------

Use this table to determine the version of Runtime that will support the
version of NEFF you are using. NEFF version is determined by the version
of the Neuron Compiler.

============ ===================== ===================================
NEFF Version Runtime Version Range Notes
============ ===================== ===================================
0.6          \*                    All versions of RT support NEFF 0.6
1.0          >= 1.0.6905.0         Starting support for 1.0 NEFFs 
2.0          >= 1.6.5.0            Starting support for 2.0 NEFFs

Neuron Runtime 2.x (``libnrt.so``) release [2.2.18.0]
-----------------------------------------------------

Date: 11/05/2021

-  Resolved an issue that affect the use of Neuron within container. In previous Neuron Runtime release (libnrt.so.2.2.15.0), when /dev/neuron0
   was not used by the application, Neuron Runtime attempted and failed to initialize /dev/neuron0 because user didn't pass /dev/neuron0 to the 
   container. this Neuron Runtime release (``libnrt.so.2.2.18.0``) allows customers to launch containers with specific NeuronDevices other 
   than /dev/neuron0.
   
   

Neuron Runtime 2.x (``libnrt.so``) release [2.2.15.0]
-----------------------------------------------------

Date: 10/27/2021

New in this release
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-   :ref:`First release of Neuron Runtime 2.x <introduce-libnrt>` - In this release we are
    introducing Neuron Runtime 2.x which is a shared library named
    (``libnrt.so``) and replacing Neuron Runtime 1.x server
    (``neruon-rtd``) . Upgrading to ``libnrt.so`` improves throughput and
    latency, simplifies Neuron installation and upgrade process,
    introduces new capabilities for allocating NeuronCores to
    applications, streamlines container creation, and deprecates tools
    that are no longer needed. The new library-based runtime
    (``libnrt.so``) is integrated into Neuronâ€™s ML Frameworks (with the exception of MXNet 1.5) and Neuron
    Tools packages directly - users no longer need to install/deploy the
    ``aws-neuron-runtime``\ package. 

    .. important::

        -  You must update to the latest Neuron Driver (``aws-neuron-dkms`` version 2.1 or newer) 
           for proper functionality of the new runtime library.
        -  Read :ref:`introduce-libnrt`
           application note that describes :ref:`why are we making this
           change <introduce-libnrt-why>` and
           how :ref:`this change will affect the Neuron
           SDK <introduce-libnrt-how-sdk>` in detail.
        -  Read :ref:`neuron-migrating-apps-neuron-to-libnrt` for detailed information of how to
           migrate your application.
