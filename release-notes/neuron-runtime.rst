.. _14120:

[1.4.12.0]
=========

Date: 03/04/2021

Improvements
------------

-  Bug fixes and minor enhancements.


.. _1490:

[1.4.9.0]
=========

Date: 02/24/2021

Improvements
------------

-  Fix for CVE-2021-3177.


.. _1430:

[1.4.3.0]
=========

Date: 01/30/2021

Improvements
------------

-  Model load time has been improved by approximately 10% after changing runtime to avoid disk access.
-  Improved return code when invalid/incomplete neffs are passed to runtime.


.. _1310:

[1.3.1.0]
=========

Date: 12/23/2020

Improvements
------------

-  Model load time has been improved.  The model loading speed up could be up to 50% depending on the size of the model.

Resolved Issues
---------------

-  Incorrect error code returned when a model fails to load due to the lack of resources.
-  Restarting Neuron Runtime causes a memory leak in the Neuron kernel module.


.. _1250:

[1.2.5.0]
=========

Date: 11/17/2020

Major New Features
------------------

-  Removed limitations on intermediate tensors in networks compiled for
   NeuronCore Pipeline. Previously, NeuronCores executing the pipeline
   could pass their outputs no further then to the NeuronCores on the
   same or the next Inferetia on an instance. This limitation is removed
   and a NeuronCore can now pass its outputs to any other NeuronCore in
   the NeuronCore Pipeline. This feature allows for deeper pipelines
   utilizing more NeuronCores that can result in better performance.

Resolved Issues
---------------

-  Reloading Neuron Kernel Mode Driver causes memory leak
-  Memory pool initialization can reference NULL pointer in case of a
   failure.
-  A network fails to load on Inferetia with “Incorrect number of
   inputs” error. In some cases the Neuron Compiler could determine that
   a network input is a constant. The compiler then optimizes the input
   away to improve the performance. This action could create a mismatch
   between the inputs to the network submitted by a framework and the
   inputs expected by Inferentia causing errors during load.

.. _1114020:

[1.1.1402.0]
============

Date: 10/22/2020

.. _major-new-features-1:

Major New Features
------------------

This release introduces Neuron Kernel Mode Driver (KMD) as a new package
aws-neuron-dkms. Neuron KMD removes the following requirments for Neuron
Runtime:

-  Passing of CAP_SYS_ADMIN to Neuron Runtime.
-  User management of huge page system resources
-  Execution of Neuron Runtime in a “sidecar” container.

This packages is required for regular operation of Neuron Runtime; hence
it is marked as dependency for ``aws-neuron-runtime-base`` see 
:ref:`neuron-install-guide` for detailed installation
steps.

.. _resolved-issues-1:

Resolved Issues
---------------

-  NEFF is container of files. When NEFF is generated on some host the
   content files permissions are inherited causing NEFF load failure in
   the inf1 instances. Fixed it by removing file permissions before
   loading it.



.. _1095920:

[1.0.9592.0]
============

Date: 09/22/2020

Major New Features
------------------

-  n/a

Improvements
------------

-  The “handshake” API can be used between a framework, such as
   TensorFlow, and neuron-rtd. The API establishes a unique “session-id”
   (see the next item) and facilitates version exchange between a
   framework and neuron-rtd. Version information is used to improve
   logging and troubleshooting.
-  The API for neural networks loading and for shared memory allocation
   have been enhanced to allow an optional “session id” to be passed in
   load/allocate requests. Session ids are used to associate a framework
   process with the networks and the shared memory segments used by the
   process. Neuron-rtd can optionally monitor framework processes and
   automatically unload all neural networks loaded by the process and
   free its shared memory when the process terminates.

Resolved Issues
---------------

-  querying Neuron statistics could cause neuron-rtd to crash

-  SRAM parity errors are not reported

-  Under stress “queue full” error can be returned when submitting an
   inference request even when neuron-rtd has room for one more request

.. _1091970:

[1.0.9197.0]

============

Date: 07/16/2020

.. _major-new-features-4:

Major New Features
------------------

-  n/a

.. _improvements-1:

Improvements
------------

-  Improved performance of the Neural Networks with large input tensors.

.. _resolved-issues-4:

Resolved Issues
---------------

-  neuron-rtd crashes when “Unload All” API is called multiple times.
-  In some cases neuron-compiler optimizes access to the input tensors.
   Because of this optimization inference requests fail with an error
   message indicating the mismatch between expected and supplied number
   of input tensors.
-  In some cases NEFF can use more DMA rings than is supported by
   neuron-rtd. A Neural Network load fails to load with an error message
   indicating the failure to allocate a DMA ring.

Other Notes
-----------

-  Renamed and combined Neuron device memory errors counters. Four
   counters - ddr0_ecc_corr, ddr0_ecc_uncorr, ddr1_ecc_corr,
   ddr1_ecc_uncorr were combined into two counters - mem_ecc_corr and
   mem_ecc_uncorr.

Improvements
------------

-  n/a

.. _resolved-issues-5:

Resolved Issues
---------------

-  In the versions of aws-neuron-runtime-base and aws-neuron-runtime,
   yum downgrade/update removed the service unit files. This results in
   neuron-discovery and neuron-rtd start failures.

Please update the Neuron Runtime ingredients on AL2 by first removing
the old package and installing the latest:

::

   # Amazon Linux 2
   sudo yum remove aws-neuron-runtime-base
   sudo yum remove aws-neuron-runtime
   sudo yum install aws-neuron-runtime-base
   sudo yum install aws-neuron-runtime

.. _1078650:

Major New Features
------------------

-  n/a

.. _improvements-3:

Improvements
------------

-  Improved Neuron device memory allocation to accommodate Neural
   Networks that operate on large tensors.
-  Log the version of the NEFF file during Neural Network load to aid
   troubleshooting.

.. _resolved-issues-6:

Resolved Issues
---------------

-  An inference request with missing IFMAP tensors is allowed to execute
   and produces undefined results.
-  neuron-rtd service is not stopped and is not removed when
   aws-neuron-runtime package is uninstalled.

Known Issues and Limitations
----------------------------

-  A model might fail to load due to insufficient number of huge memory
   pages made available to Neuron-RTD.

Major New Features
------------------

-  Support is added for NEFF 1.0.

.. _improvements-4:

Improvements

   all Inferentia resources. The API is used by ML frameworks in cases
   when an ML application needs to be restarted to bring Inferentias to
   their initial state.
-  Improved inference error handling and improved verbosity of error
   notifications.
-  Internal changes aimed to improve performance optimization work and
   debuggability.

.. _resolved-issues-7:

.. _major-new-features-8:

Major New Features
------------------

N/A

.. _improvements-5:

Improvements
------------

-  Inferentia memory utilization has improved, allowing larger number of
   Neural Networks to be loaded simultaneously. The increased capacity
   could be up to 25% depending on the networks.
-  Added an API to read performance counters for a single Neuron Core.
   Used internally by neuron-top, which comes with the aws-neuron-tools
   package.
-  Added Neural Network caching. Caching of previously loaded Neural
   Networks in host memory can significantly speed up (up to 10x) the
   subsequent loading of the same networks, for example when using
   multiple Neuron Cores in data-parallel mode.

.. _resolved-issues-8:

Resolved Issues
---------------

-  Occassional neuron-rt service crashes when service was being
   shutdown.

.. _1057950:

[1.0.5795.0]
============

Date: 2/27/2020

.. _major-new-features-9:

Major New Features
------------------

-  Added API to unload all models available via "neuron-cli reset".

.. _improvements-6:

Improvements
------------

-  Neural Network Load and Neural Network Infer interfaces return
   descriptive error messages on failure.
-  Throughput of Neural Networks running in NeuronCore Pipeline mode has
   improved by 10-50% (network dependent) by reducing contention among
   NeuronCores.
-  Improved CPU utilization of neuron-rt daemon by completely removing
   one polling thread from neuron-rt.

.. _resolved-issues-9:

Resolved Issues
---------------

-  Neural Networks containing CPU partitions only do not load correctly.

-  Insufficient logging makes it hard to identify Neural Network loading
   failure when multiple networks are loaded in parallel.

.. _known-issues-and-limitations-3:

Known Issues and Limitations

Major New Features
------------------

N/A

.. _improvements-7:

Improvements
------------

-  Improved neuron-rtd startup time on inf1.6xl and inf1.24xl.
   Neuron-rtd startup now takes the same amount of time on all instance
   sizes.
-  Improved inference latency for Neural Networks that fully execute on
   Inferentia (have no on-CPU nodes). The exact latency improvement is
   network dependent and is estimated to be 50-100us per inference.
-  Neural Network load GRPC returns descriptive error message when the
   load fails.
-  Changed default behavior of neuron-rtd to drop elevated privileges
   after runtime initialization. During initialization elevated
   priveleges are necessary to allow bus enumeration and shared memory
   with frameworks.
-  Error log is automatically displayed on the console if the
   installation of aws-neuron-runtime fails.
