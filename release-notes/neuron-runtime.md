# Neuron runtime release notes

This document lists the current release notes for AWS Neuron Runtime.  Neuron Runtime software manages runtime aspects of executing inferences on Inferentia chips. It runs on Ubuntu(16/18) and Amazon Linux 2.


# [1.0.5795.0]

Date: 2/27/2020

## Major New Features

* Added API to unload all models available via "neuron-cli reset".

## Improvements

* Neural Network Load and Neural Network Infer interfaces return descriptive error messages on failure.
* Throughput of Neural Networks running in NeuronCore Pipeline mode has improved by 10-50% (network dependent) by reducing contention among NeuronCores. 
* Improved CPU utilization of neuron-rt daemon by completely removing one polling thread from neuron-rt. 

## Resolved Issues

* Neural Networks containing CPU partitions only do not load correctly.
* Insufficient logging makes it hard to identify Neural Network loading failure when multiple networks are loaded in parallel.


## Known Issues and Limitations

* A model might fail to load due to insufficient number of huge memory pages made available to Neuron-RTD.  For example, 
. A manual reconfiguration and Neuron-RTD restart is required for increasing the amount of huge memory pages available to Neuron-RTD.
    * Workaround: manually increase the amount of huge memory pages available to Neuron runtime by following the [instructions here.](https://github.com/aws/aws-neuron-sdk/blob/master/docs/neuron-runtime/nrt_start.md#step-3-configure-nr_hugepages) (Requires a restart of the runtime daemon and a possible change to system-wide configs.)


# [1.0.5236.0]

Date: 1/27/2020

## Major New Features

N/A

## Improvements

* Improved neuron-rtd startup time on inf1.6xl and inf1.24xl.  Neuron-rtd startup now takes the same amount of time on all instance sizes. 
* Improved inference latency for Neural Networks that fully execute on Inferentia (have no on-CPU nodes).  The exact latency improvement is network dependent and is estimated to be 50-100us per inference. 
* Neural Network load GRPC returns descriptive error message when the load fails.
* Changed default behavior of neuron-rtd to drop elevated privileges after runtime initialization.  During initialization elevated priveleges are necessary to allow bus enumeration and shared memory with frameworks.
* Error log is automatically displayed on the console if the installation of aws-neuron-runtime fails.

## Resolved Issues

* minor bug fixes

## Known Issues and Limitations

* A model might fail to load due to insufficient number of huge memory pages made available to Neuron-RTD. A manual reconfiguration and Neuron-RTD restart is required for increasing the amount of huge memory pages available to Neuron-RTD.
    * Workaround: manually increase the amount of huge memory pages available to Neuron runtime by following the [instructions here.](https://github.com/aws/aws-neuron-sdk/blob/master/docs/neuron-runtime/nrt_start.md#step-3-configure-nr_hugepages) (Requires a restart of the runtime daemon and a possible change to system-wide configs.)
* Neuron-RTD does not return verbose error messages when an inference fails. Detailed error messages are only available in syslog.
    * Workaround: manually search syslog file for Neuron-RTD error messages.




# [1.0.4751.0]

Date: 12/20/2019

## Major New Features

N/A

## Improvements

* Improved neuron-rtd startup time on inf1.24xl
* Reduced inference submission overhead (improved inference latency)
* Made the names and the UUIDs of loaded models available to neuron-tools

## Resolved Issues

The following issues have been resolved:

* File I/O errors are not checked during model load
* Memory leak during model unload
* Superfluous error message are logged while reading neuron-rtd configuration file
* neuron-rtd --version command does not work

## Known Issues and Limitations

* A model might fail to load due to insufficient number of huge memory pages made available to Neuron-RTD. A manual reconfiguration and Neuron-RTD restart is required for increasing the amount of huge memory pages available to Neuron-RTD.
  * Workaround: manually increase the amount of huge memory pages available to Neuron runtime by following the [instructions here:](https://github.com/aws/aws-neuron-sdk/blob/master/docs/neuron-runtime/nrt_start.md#step-3-configure-nr_hugepages) (Requires a restart of the runtime daemon and a possible change to system-wide configs.)
* Neuron-RTD does not return verbose error messages when a model load or an inference fails. Detailed error messages are only available in syslog.
  * Workaround: manually search syslog file for Neuron-RTD error messages.

# [1.0.4492.0]

Date: 12/1/2019

## Major New Features

N/A

## Resolved Issues

The following issues have been resolved:

* Neuron-RTD fails to initialize all NeuronCores on Inf1.24xl Inferentia instances
* On some instances neuron-discovery requires packages (pciutils)
* An inference request might timeout or return a failure when a NeuronCore Pipeline model is loaded on any instance larger than Inf1.xl or Inf1.2xla
* Loading of a model fails when NeuronCore Pipeline inputs are consumed by NeuronCores beyond the first 4 NeuronCores used by the model
* Neuron-RTD logging to stdout does not work
* Incorrect DMA descriptors validation.  While loading a model; descriptors are allowed to point beyond allocated address ranges.  This could cause the model load failure or produce incorrect numerical results
* NeuronCore statistics are read incorrectly

## Known Issues and Limitations

* A model might fail to load due to insufficient number of huge memory pages made available to Neuron-RTD.  A manual reconfiguration and Neuron-RTD restart is required for increasing the amount of huge memory pages available to Neuron-RTD.
    * Workaround: manually increase the amount of huge memory pages available to Neuron runtime by following the [instructions here:](../docs/neuron-runtime/nrt_start.md#step-3-configure-nr_hugepages) 
    (Requires a restart of the runtime daemon and a possible change to system-wide configs.)
* Neuron-RTD does not return verbose error messages when a model load or an inference fails.  Detailed error messages are only available in syslog.
    * Workaround: manually search syslog file for Neuron-RTD error messages.
* Neuron-RTD takes 6 minutes to start on Inf1.24xl instance.

## Major Resolved issues

## Known issues and limitations

* Neuron-RTD fails to initialize all NeuronCores on Inf1.24xl Inferentia instances.
    * Workarounds: update to next release
* On some instances neuron-discovery requires packages (pciutils) 
    * Workaround: install explicitly
* An inference request might timeout or return a failure when a NeuronCore Pipeline model is loaded on any instance larger than Inf1.xl or Inf1.2xla
    * Workarounds: update to the next release
* Loading of a model fails when NeuronCore Pipeline inputs are consumed by NeuronCores beyond the first 4 NeuronCores used by the model.  
A model can be compiled to run on multiple NeuronCores spread across multiple Inferentias.  The modelâ€™s inference inputs (ifmaps) can be 
consumed by one or more NeuronCores, depending on a model.  If a model requires inputs going to NeuronCores beyond the first 4 the loading of the model will fail. 
    * Workarounds: update to the next release
* Neuron-RTD logging to stdout does not work

* Incorrect DMA descriptors validation.  While loading a model; descriptors are allowed to point beyond allocated address ranges.  This could cause the model load failure or produce incorrect numerical results.
