Known Issues and Limitations - Updated 08/12/2021
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following are not torch-neuron limitations, but may impact models
you can successfully torch.neuron.trace

-  If you attempt to import torch.neuron from Python 3.5 you will see this error in 1.1.7.0 - please use Python 3.6 or greater:
.. code-block::

   File "/tmp/install_test_env/lib/python3.5/site-packages/torch_neuron/__init__.py", line 29
      f'Invalid dependency version torch=={torch.__version__}. '
                                                             ^
   SyntaxError: invalid syntax

-  Torchvision has dropped support for Python 3.5
-  HuggingFace transformers has dropped support for Python 3.5
-  aten::max only correctly implements the simplest versions of that
   operator, the variants that return a tuple with arg max now return
   NotImplementedError during compilation
-  There is a dependency between versions of torchvision and the torch package that customers should be aware of when compiling torchvision models.  These dependency rules can be managed through pip.  At the time of writing torchvision==0.6.1 matched the torch==1.5.1 release, and torchvision==0.8.2 matched the torch==1.7.1 release


PyTorch Neuron release [2.0.392.0]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Date: 11/05/2021

* Updated Neuron Runtime (which is integrated within this package) to ``libnrt 2.2.18.0`` to fix a container issue that was preventing 
  the use of containers when /dev/neuron0 was not present. See details here :ref:`neuron-runtime-release-notes`.

PyTorch Neuron release [2.0.318.0]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Date: 10/27/2021

New in this release
-------------------

-  PyTorch Neuron 1.x now support Neuron Runtime 2.x (``libnrt.so`` shared library) only.

     .. important::

        -  You must update to the latest Neuron Driver (``aws-neuron-dkms`` version 2.1 or newer) 
           for proper functionality of the new runtime library.
        -  Read :ref:`introduce-libnrt`
           application note that describes :ref:`why are we making this
           change <introduce-libnrt-why>` and
           how :ref:`this change will affect the Neuron
           SDK <introduce-libnrt-how-sdk>` in detail.
        -  Read :ref:`neuron-migrating-apps-neuron-to-libnrt` for detailed information of how to
           migrate your application.

-  Introducing PyTorch 1.9.1 support (support for ``torch==1.9.1)``
-  Added ``torch_neuron.DataParallel``, see ResNet-50 tutorial :ref:`[html] </src/examples/pytorch/resnet50.ipynb>` and
   :ref:`torch-neuron-dataparallel-app-note` application note.
-  Added support for tracing on GPUs
-  Added support for ``ConvTranspose1d``
-  Added support for new operators:

   -  ``aten::empty_like``
   -  ``aten::log``
   -  ``aten::type_as``
   -  ``aten::movedim``
   -  ``aten::einsum``
   -  ``aten::argmax``
   -  ``aten::min``
   -  ``aten::argmin``
   -  ``aten::abs``
   -  ``aten::cos``
   -  ``aten::sin``
   -  ``aten::linear``
   -  ``aten::pixel_shuffle``
   -  ``aten::group_norm``
   -  ``aten::_weight_norm``

-  Added ``torch_neuron.is_available()``


Resolved Issues
---------------

-  Fixed a performance issue when using both the
   ``dynamic_batch_size=True`` trace option and
   ``--neuron-core-pipeline`` compiler option. Dynamic batching now uses
   ``OpenMP`` to execute pipeline batches concurrently.
-  Fixed ``torch_neuron.trace`` issues:

   -  Fixed a failure when the same submodule was traced with multiple
      inputs
   -  Fixed a failure where some operations would fail to be called with
      the correct arguments
   -  Fixed a failure where custom operators (torch plugins) would cause
      a trace failure

-  Fixed variants of ``aten::upsample_bilinear2d`` when
   ``scale_factor=1``
-  Fixed variants of ``aten::expand`` using ``dim=-1``
-  Fixed variants of ``aten::stack`` using multiple different input data
   types
-  Fixed variants of ``aten::max`` using indices outputs

[1.0.627.0]
^^^^^^^^^^^

Date: 12/20/2019

.. _summary-9:

Summary
-------

This is the initial release of torch-neuron. It is not distributed on
the DLAMI yet and needs to be installed from the neuron pip repository.

Note that we are currently using a TensorFlow as an intermediate format
to pass to our compiler. This does not affect any runtime execution from
PyTorch to Neuron Runtime and Inferentia. This is why the neuron-cc
installation must include [tensorflow] for PyTorch.

Known issues and limitations
----------------------------

Models TESTED
-------------

The following models have successfully run on neuron-inferentia systems

1. SqueezeNet
2. ResNet50
3. Wide ResNet50

Pytorch Serving
---------------

In this initial version there is no specific serving support. Inference
works correctly through Python on Inf1 instances using the neuron
runtime. Future releases will include support for production deployment
and serving of models

Profiler support
----------------

Profiler support is not provided in this initial release and will be
available in future releases

Automated partitioning
----------------------

Automatic partitioning of graphs into supported and non-supported
operations is not currently supported. A tutorial is available to
provide guidance on how to manually parition a model graph. Please see
:ref:`pytorch-manual-partitioning-jn-tutorial`

PyTorch dependency
------------------

Currently PyTorch support depends on a Neuron specific version of
PyTorch v1.3.1. Future revisions will add support for 1.4 and future
releases.

Trace behavior
--------------

In order to trace a model it must be in evaluation mode. For examples
please see :ref:`/src/examples/pytorch/resnet50.ipynb`

Six pip package is required
---------------------------

The Six package is required for the torch-neuron runtime, but it is not
modeled in the package dependencies. This will be fixed in a future
release.

Multiple NeuronCore support
---------------------------

If the num-neuroncores options is used the number of cores must be
manually set in the calling shell environment variable for compilation
and inference.

For example: Using the keyword argument
compiler_args=['—num-neuroncores', '4'] in the trace call, requires
NEURONCORE_GROUP_SIZES=4 to be set in the environment at compile time
and runtime

CPU execution
-------------

At compilation time a constant output is generated for the purposes of
tracing. Running inference on a non neuron instance will generate
incorrect results. This must not be used. The following error message is
generated to stderr:

::

   Warning: Tensor output are ** NOT CALCULATED ** during CPU execution and only
   indicate tensor shape
