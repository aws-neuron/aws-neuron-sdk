Resolved Issues
---------------

N/A - first release

.. _known-issues--limits-1:

---------------------

-  Must install TensorBoard-Neuron by itself, or after regular
   TensorBoard is installed. If regular Tensorboard is installed after
   TensorBoard-Neuron, it may overwrite some needed files.
-  Utilization missing in Op Profile due to missing FLOPs calculation
   (see overview page instead)
-  Neuron Profile plugin may not immediately show up on launch (try
   reloading the page)
-  Graphs with NeuronOps may take a long time to load due to attribute
   size
-  Instructions that cannot be matched to a framework layer/operator
   name show as “” (blank)
-  CPU Usage section in chrome-trace is not applicable
-  Debugger currently supports TensorFlow only
-  Visualization requires a TensorFlow-compatible graph
