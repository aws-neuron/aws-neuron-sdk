Neuron 1.14.0 (05/28/2021)
--------------------------

This release (Neuron 1.14.0) introduces first release of Neuron PyTorch 1.8.1, tutorials update, performance enhancements and memory optimizations for Neuron PyTorch, Neuron TensorFlow and Neuron MXNet.


* Neuron PyTorch - First release of Neuron PyTorch 1.8.1.
* Neuron PyTorch - Convolution operator support has been extended to include ConvTranspose2d variants.
* Neuron PyTorch - Updated  tutorials to use Hugging Face Transformers 4.6.0.
* Neuron PyTorch - Additional performance enhancements, memory optimizations, and bug fixes. see :ref:`pytorch-neuron-rn`.
* Neuron Compiler - New feature  -  Uncompressed NEFF format for faster loading models prior inference. Enable it by â€“enable-fast-loading-neuron-binaries. Some cases of large models may be detrimentally  impacted as it will not be compressed but many cases will benefit.
* Neuron Compiler - Additional performance enhancements, memory optimizations, and bug fixes, see :ref:`neuron-cc-rn`.
* Neuron TensorFlow - Performance enhancements, memory optimizations, and bug fixes. see :ref:`tensorflow-neuron-rn`. 
* Neuron MXNet - Enhancements and minor bug fixes (MXNet 1.8), see :ref:`mxnet-neuron-rn`.
* Neuron Runtime - Performance enhancements, memory optimizations, and bug fixes. :ref:`neuron-runtime-release-notes`.
* Neuron Tools - Minor bug fixes and enhancements.
* Software Deprecation

    * End of support for Neuron Conda packages in Deep Learning AMI, users should use pip upgrade commands to upgrade to latest Neuron version in DLAMI, see `blog <https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/neuron-conda-packages-eol/>`_.
    * End of support for Ubuntu 16, see  `documentation <https://awsdocs-neuron.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/release-notes/deprecation.html>`_.
