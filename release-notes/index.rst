.. note::
    The AWS Neuron SDK is updated regularly with new versions. These releases follow a semantic versioning model of ``(major).(minor).(patch)``. ``major`` versions are more likely to introduce new features and breaking changes over a prior major version. ``minor`` versions add feature and API improvements and may introduce smaller breaking changes. ``patch`` versions typically provide bug fixes and will not have breaking changes.
