Neuron 1.16.0
-------------

Date: 10/27/2021

New in this release
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Starting with Neuron 1.16.0, use of Neuron ML Frameworks now comes
   with an integrated Neuron Runtime as a library, as a result it is
   no longer needed to deploy ``neuron-rtd``. Please visit :ref:`neuron-containers` for more
   information.
-  When using containers built with components from Neuron 1.16.0, or
   newer, please use ``aws-neuron-dkms`` version 2.1 or newer and the
   latest version of ``aws-neuron-runtime-base``. Passing additional
   system capabilities is no longer required.
