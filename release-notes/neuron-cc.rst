Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This document lists the release notes for AWS Neuron compiler. The
Neuron Compiler is an ahead-of-time compiler that ensures Neuron will
optimally utilize the Inferentia chips.

Operator-support for each input format is provided directly from the
compiler.

::

   neuron-cc list-operators --framework {TENSORFLOW | MXNET | ONNX}

The supported operators are also listed here:

Tensorflow: :ref:`neuron-cc-ops-tensorflow`

Pytorch: :ref:`neuron-cc-ops-pytorch`

Apache MXNet (Incubating): :ref:`neuron-cc-ops-mxnet`

ONNX: :ref:`neuron-cc-ops-onnx`



Known issues and limitations - updated 05/28/2021
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* *Control flow* Neuron only supports control flow operators which are static at compile time. For example static length RNN, top-k, sort.
* *Data layout* The Neuron compiler supports multiple data layout format (NCHW, NHWC, …). Non-CNHW input/output data-layouts will require Neuron to insert additional transpose operations, causing a degradation in performance.
* *Primary inputs in NeuronCore Pipeline mode* When a neural network is executed in NeuronCore Pipeline mode, only the first operator in a neural network can receive primary inputs from the host.
* *Reduce data type* INT8 data type is not currently supported by the Neuron compiler.
* *NeuronCore Pipeline:* NeuronCorePipeline mode provides low-latency and high-throughput for small batch sizes. We recommend to start testing with batch=1 and gradually increase batch size to fine tune your model throughput and latency performance.
* *Conv2d operator* is mapped to Inferentia except for specific cases of extremely large tensors and specific parameters.

[1.4.1.0]
^^^^^^^^^

Date 5/28/2021

Summary
-------

- Performance improvements, and usability improvements.

Major New Features
------------------

* Added uncompressed NEFF format for faster loading models prior inference. Enable it by –enable-fast-loading-neuron-binaries. Some cases of large models may be detrminentally impacted as it will not be compressed but many cases will benefit.
* Corrected compilation error in specific arguments of ResizeBilinear operator

[1.3.0.0]
^^^^^^^^^

Date 4/30/2021

Summary
-------

- Performance improvements, new operators, and usability improvements.

Major New Features
------------------

- Improved performance of batched CNN models like resnet50  with the default compiler options by 10%.

- Improved performance of bert base sequence 128 batch 6 by upto 16%

- Added support for group and depth wise convolution (with limited performance when the number of input channels is small).

- Added more detailed debug names to support for tensorboard.


Resolved Issues
---------------

- Corrected potential race condition in overwriting tiles of output tensors.

- Fixed various issues in pipelined inference by enabling fine grain partitioning by default.




[1.2.7.0]
^^^^^^^^^

Date 2/24/2021

Summary
-------

Fix for CVE-2021-3177.

[1.2.2.0]
^^^^^^^^^

Date 1/30/2021

Summary
-------

Added suport for multiple new operators (see operators list) for Tensoflow and MXNET. Improved inference performance of language, object recognition models on single as well as multiple pipelined cores using neuroncore-pipeline. 

Major New Features
------------------

- The following models are now supported: Resnext 224x224, specific BERT variations applied to natural language processing and translation.

- A number of new operators is now supported on Inferentia, see the full lists :ref:`neuron-cc-ops-tensorflow`
 and :ref:`neuron-cc-ops-mxnet`

- Improved inference performance on yolov4 BERT base sequence 64 (on 16 pipelined cores) and openpose 184.

Resolved Issues
---------------

- Corrected a random failure to compile Resnet50 batch 5

- Corrected numerical inaccuracy in RSQRT and related operators for tensors with very large values ( > 1e20)






[1.1.7.0]
^^^^^^^^^

Date 12/23/2020

Summary
-------

Added suport for PyTorch Yolo V4, a new Framework-visible progress bar and improved inference performance. We continue to streamline the compiler usability by removing the need for options passed to control behavior. We are aiming to remove the need for such options entirely. Some tutorials have been updated to reflect this, but Resnet50 remains in need of these options to achieve maximum performance. Other useability improvements have been added, such as the compiler progress bar. As always, please let us know if there are other areas that we can improve.


Major New Features
------------------
- Pytorch Yolo V4 is now supported.

- Added a compiler progress bar when compilation is invoked from the Framework. This allows the user to see that progress continues as compilation proceeds, which is useful when compilation takes several minutes. A dot is printed every 20 seconds.

- Improved inference performance of Tensorflow BERT base seq 256 batch 3 by 10% .

Resolved Issues
---------------
- Resolved issue with depthwise convolution that manifests as a type check error 


.. _10240450:

[1.0.24045.0]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Date 11/17/2020

Summary
-------

Improved performance for pipelined execution (NeuronCore Pipeline).

Major New Features
------------------

-  NeuronCore Pipeline: improved partitioning to enable better static
   weights loading to cache.

Resolved Issues
---------------

-  --static-weights : No longer needed. As this is shown in some
   examples, please remove the option since the compiler now performs
   this auto-detection by default.

-  --num-neuroncores renamed to --neuroncore-pipeline-cores. The prior
   option form is still functional (backwards compatible) and will be
   removed in future releases.

-  --batching_en: Resolved compilation failure of ResNet50 FP32 batch 1
   on Ubuntu16 when "--batching_en" was used.


.. _neuron-cc-10206000:

[1.0.20600.0]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Summary
-------

Various performance improvements - both compilation time and inference
speed of object recognition models.

-  Compiler optimization '-O2' option is now enabled by default.

.. _major-new-features-1:

Major New Features
------------------

-  Improved inference performance of YOLO v3, YOLO v4, VGG16, SSD300.
   BERT models were improved by an additional 10%.

Bug fixes and some performance enhancement related to data movement for
BERT-type neural networks.

.. _major-new-features-7:

Major New Features
------------------

None

.. _resolved-issues-7:

Resolved Issues
---------------

-  Improved throughput for operators processed in the Neuron Runtime
   CPU. As an example: execution of 4 single NeuronCore NEFF models of
   ResNet50 v2 float16 batch = 5 in parallel on an inf1.1xlarge sped up
   by 30%.
-  Corrected shape handling in Gather(TensorFlow)/Take(MXNet) operators
   that are processed by the Neuron Runtime in the Neuron Runtime vCPU,
   which resolves a possible crash in Neuron Compiler when compiling
   models with these operators with some shapes.
-  Added support for TensorFlow *OneHot* operator (as a Neuron Runtime
   CPU operator).
-  Added more internal checking for compiler correctness with newly
   defined error messages for this case.

::

         “Internal ERROR: Data race between Op1 'Name1(...) [...]' and Op2 'Name2(...) [...]'”

-  Fixed out-of-memory issue introduced in 1.0.5939.0 such that some
   large models (BERT) compiled on instances with insufficient host
   memory would cause the runtime to crash with an invalid NEFF. This is
   actually a compiler error, but due to additional script layers
   wrapping this in the :ref:`tensorflow-bert-demo`, this would
   have likely been seen as a runtime error like this:

.. code:: bash

   2020-01-09 13:40:26.002594: E tensorflow/core/framework/op_segment.cc:54] Create kernel failed: Invalid argument: neff is invalid
   2020-01-09 13:40:26.002637: E tensorflow/core/common_runtime/executor.cc:642] Executor failed to create kernel. Invalid argument: neff is invalid
   [[{{node bert/NeuronOp}}]]

.. _known-issues-and-limitations-2:

Known issues and limitations
----------------------------

See previous release notes. Some tutorials show use of specific compiler
options and flags, these are needed to help provide guidance to the
compiler to achieve best performance in specific cases. Please do not
use in cases other than as shown in the specific tutorial as results may
not be defined. These options should be considered experimental and will
be removed over time.

N/A, this is the first release.

.. _known-issues-and-limitations-5:

Known issues and limitations
----------------------------

1. **Control flow** Inferentia has a limited support for control flow.
   In general, Neuron can only support control flow operators which are
   static at compile time, i.e. static length RNN, top-k, sort, ...
2. **Size of neural network** The size of neural network is influenced
   by a) type of neural network (CNN, LSTM, MLP) , b) number of layers,
   c) sizes of input (dimension of the tensors, batch size, ...). The
   current Neuron compiler release has a limitation in terms of the size
   of neural network it could effectively optimize. As a result, we
   limit CNN models (e.g. ResNet) to have an input size of up to 480x480
   FP16, batch size of 4; LSTM models (e.g. GNMT) are limited to a time
   step limit of up to 900; MLP models (like BERT) are limited up to
   sequence-length equal 128, batch=8.
3. **Data layout** The Neuron compiler supports multiple data layout
   format (NCHW, NHWC, ...). Non-CNHW input/output data-layouts will
   require Neuron to insert additional *transpose* operations, causing a
   degradation in performance.
4. **Object detection models** Computer-vision object detection and
   segmentation models are not supported by the current release.
5. **Reduce data type** INT8 data type is not currently supported by the
   Neuron compiler.
6. **Tensor residency** When a sub-graph that is executed on the host is
   communicating with a sub-graph that is executing on Neuron cores,
   tensors are copied via the communication queues between the host and
   Inferentia memory for each inference, which may result in end-to-end
   performance degradation.
7. **Primary inputs in NeuronCore Pipeline mode** When a neural network
   is executed in NeuronCore Pipeline mode, only the first operator in a
   neural network can receive primary inputs from the host.
