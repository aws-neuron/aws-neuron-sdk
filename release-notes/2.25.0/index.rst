Support announcements
---------------------

This section signals the official deprecation or end of support for specific features, tools, and APIs.

End-of-support announcements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*An "end-of-support (EoS)" announcement is a notification that a feature, tool, or API will not be supported in the future. Plan accordingly!*

* In a future release, the Neuron Compiler default flag ``--auto-cast=matmult`` will change to ``--auto-cast=none``.

  This means the Neuron Compiler will no longer perform auto-casting and use the data types of the operators in the incoming HLO. If the current behavior is desired, users can explicitly pass the  ``--auto-cast=matmult`` and  ``--auto-cast-type=bf16`` options to the compiler.  

  **Note:** This change will not affect Neuron NxDI, NxDT, and TNx Frameworks as these are set to ``--auto-cast=none`` by default. However, Torch-Neuronx users may experience an impact and must adjust their settings if they rely on the previous auto-casting behavior.

* Starting from Neuron Release 2.24, the Hugging Face Transformers NeuronX library is deprecated and in maintenance mode. ``transformers-neuronx`` releases will now only address critical security issues. In Neuron Release 2.26, Neuron will end support for transformers-neuronx. Current users of ``transformers-neuronx`` are advised to migrate to :doc:`NeuronX Distributed Inference </libraries/nxd-inference/nxdi-overview>`.

* PyTorch version 2.6 will no longer be supported in a coming release.  Current users of PyTorch 2.6 are advised to upgrade to PyTorch 2.7, which is supported in this release.

* Support for Python 3.9 will end in a coming release. Currently, we support versions of Python up to 3.11. Current users of Python 3.9 are advised to upgrade to Python 3.11, which is supported in this release.

Ending support in 2.25.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Items listed here are officially no longer supported starting with Neuron 2.25.0.*

* The following tutorials are no longer supported and have been moved the to :doc:`AWS Neuron SDK doc archive </archive/index>`:
  
  * :doc:`/archive/tutorials/finetune_t5`
  * :doc:`/archive/tutorials/ssd300_demo/ssd300_demo`
  * :doc:`/archive/tutorials/megatron_gpt_pretraining`

* Neuron 2.25 is the last release supporting NxDT Megatron Models. Future Neuron releases will not include support for NxDT Megatron Models. Current users of the NxDT Megatron Models are advised to use the Hugging Face model instead by setting the ``CONF_FILE`` variable in the ``train.sh`` file to the config model you want to use.

* With version 2.25.0, Neuron no longer supports vLLM version 0.7.2. Current users of vLLM 0.7.2 are advised to upgrade to vLLM 0.9.1, which is supported in this release.

* Transformers for NeuronX is no longer supported. For more details, see :doc:`the prior announcement </general/announcements/neuron2.x/announce-intent-maintenance-tnx>`.
