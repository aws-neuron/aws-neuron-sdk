Improvements and changes
------------------------

This section of the release notes covers improvements and changes we've made to the Neuron SDK documentation and samples in this release.

* We've heard your feedback on the Neuron documentation, and we're starting on a journey to improve them. Once early change is a richer structure for the release notes with a clearer presentation of the details you're looking for. It's a small thing, but we hope it helps you!

* The front page of the AWS Neuron documentation site has been redesigned. This is the first of many improvements to the site design and navigation we'll be making across the next releases.

Support changes
---------------

Just a few final notes for this release...

* Support for Wav2Vec2 test sample datasets are currently pinned at version ``3.6.0``, as ``4.0.0`` does not support the ``patrickvonplaten/librispeech_asr_dummy`` dataset at this time.
