# [1.0.11000.0]

Date: 08/08/2020

## Summary
First release of the Neuron K8 Scheduler extension.

## Major New Features
* New scheduler extension is provided to ensure that kubelet is scheduling pods on inf1 with contiguous device ids.  Additional details about the new scheduler are provided [here](../docs/neuron-container-tools/k8s-neuron-scheduler.md), including instructions on how to apply it.  
  * NOTE: The scheduler is only required when using inf1.6xlarge and/or inf1.24xlarge
* With this release the device plugin now requires RBAC permission changes to get/patch NODE/POD objects.  Please apply the [k8s-neuron-device-plugin-rbac.yml](../docs/neuron-container-tools/k8s-neuron-device-plugin-rbac.yml) before using the new device plugin.

## Resolved Issues
* Scheduler is intended to address https://github.com/aws/aws-neuron-sdk/issues/110
