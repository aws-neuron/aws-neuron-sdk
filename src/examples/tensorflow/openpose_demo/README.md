# Running OpenPose on Inferentia

### Acknowledgement

Many thanks to https://github.com/ildoonet/tf-pose-estimation for providing pretrained model as well as the image preprocessing/pose estimating infrastructure.

### Steps

1. (Optional) Launch compilation instance. We recommend *z1d.xlarge* (highest single-core performance) + *Deep Learning AMI (Ubuntu 18.04) Version 29.0* (`ami-043f9aeaf108ebc37` in N. Virginia region).
    1. Since neuron-cc is a cross compiler, for the compilation step you may choose to install neuron-cc and tensorflow-neuron packages on your existing EC2 instance or local Linux machine.
2. Activate `aws_neuron_tensorflow_p36` conda environment (or your own virtual/conda environment) and upgrade AWS Neuron packages to latest.
    1. `source activate aws_neuron_tensorflow_p36`
    2. `conda update tensorflow-neuron`
    3. `conda update numpy`
3. Download tensorflow pose net frozen graph.
    1. `wget -c --tries=2 $( wget -q -O - http://www.mediafire.com/file/qlzzr20mpocnpa3/graph_opt.pb | grep -o 'http*://download[^"]*' | tail -n 1 ) -O graph_opt.pb`
4. Compile the pose net frozen graph into AWS Neuron compatible form. Network input image resolution is adjustable with argument `--net_resolution` (e. g., `--net_resolution=656x368`). The compiled model can accept arbitrary batch size input at runtime.
    1. `python convert_graph_opt.py graph_opt.pb graph_opt_neuron_656x368.pb`
5. Launch a deployment inf1 instance and copy the AWS Neuron optimized tensorflow frozen graph `graph_opt_neuron_656x368.pb` to the deployment inf1 instance. The smallest instance type inf1.xlarge is sufficient for this demo. If you are not on Deep Learning AMI, please remember to install runtime dependencies by `pip install -r requirements-infer.txt --extra-index-url=https://pip.repos.neuron.amazonaws.com` and `sudo apt install aws-neuron-runtime` (detail in https://github.com/aws/aws-neuron-sdk/blob/master/docs/neuron-runtime/nrt_start.md).
6. Measure performance on the compiled frozen graph using dummy inputs.
    1. `python performance_pb.py graph_opt_neuron_656x368.pb --net_resolution 656x368`

Your `graph_opt_neuron_656x368.pb` can now be plugged into https://github.com/ildoonet/tf-pose-estimation seemlessly if you have tensorflow-neuron installed. When it is used at runtime, please ensure that the image resolution is the same as compile-time image resolution, i. e., `656x368`.
