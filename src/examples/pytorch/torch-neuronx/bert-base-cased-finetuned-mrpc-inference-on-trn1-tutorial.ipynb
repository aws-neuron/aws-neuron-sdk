    "In this tutorial we will compile and deploy a HuggingFace ðŸ¤— Transformers BERT model for accelerated inference on Neuron.\n",

    "This tutorial will use the [bert-base-cased-finetuned-mrpc](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-cased-finetuned-mrpc) model. This model has 12 layers, 768 hidden dimensions, 12 attention heads, and 110M total parameters. The final layer is a binary classification head that has been trained on the Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (`mrpc`). The input to the model is two sentences and the output of the model is whether or not those sentences are a paraphrase of each other.\n",

This means that when inferring, the resulting Neuron model must be executed with tensors that are the exact same shape as those provided at compilation time. If a model is given a tensor at inference time whose shape does not match the tensor given at compilation time, an error will occur.\n",

We can satisfy the Neuron restriction of using a fixed shape input by padding all varying input tensors to a specified length. In a deployment scenario, the padding size should be chosen based on the maximum token length that is expected to occur for the application.\n",

    "In this section we benchmark the performance of the BERT model on Neuron. By default, models compiled with `torch_neuronx` will always execute on a *single* NeuronCore. When loading *multiple* models, the default behavior of the Neuron runtime is to evenly distribute models across all available NeuronCores. The runtime places models on the NeuronCore that has the fewest models loaded to it first. In the following section, we will `torch.jit.load` multiple instances of the model which should each be loaded onto their own NeuronCore. It is not useful to load more copies of a model than the number of NeuronCores on the instance since an individual NeuronCore can only execute one model at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that we are maximizing hardware utilization, we must run inferences using multiple threads in parallel. It is nearly always recommended to use some form of threading/multiprocessing and some form of model replication since even the smallest Neuron EC2 instance has 2 NeuronCores available. Applications with no form of threading are only capable of `1 / num_neuron_cores` hardware utilization which becomes especially problematic on large instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to view the hardware utilization is by executing the `neuron-top` application in the terminal while the benchmark is executing. If the monitor shows >90% utilization on all NeuronCores, this is a good indication that the hardware is being utilized effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we load two models, which utilizes all NeuronCores (2) on a `trn1.2xlarge` or `inf2.xlarge` instance. Additional models can be loaded and run in parallel on larger Trn1 or Inf2 instance sizes to increase throughput.\n",
