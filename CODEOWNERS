# This file creates codeowners for the documentation. It will allow setting code reviewers for all Pull requests to merge to the master branch 
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# @global-owner1 and @global-owner2 will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.
