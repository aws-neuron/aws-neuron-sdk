# This file creates codeowners for the documentation. It will allow setting code reviewers for all Pull requests to merge to the master branch 
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# Refernce guide - https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/about-code-owners#example-[â€¦]ners-file
# Example - These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# @global-owner1 and @global-owner2 will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.
# *       @global-owner1 @global-owner2
