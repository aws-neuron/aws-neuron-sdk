# Example: Run containerized neuron application
## Introduction:

With this example you will learn how to run a Neuron application using docker containers.

## Prerequisites:

* Please ensure the steps from the guide on [Neuron TensorFlow Serving](./../tensorflow-neuron/tutorial-tensorflow-serving.md) were completed successfully before continuing.

## Steps:
#### Step 1: Start neuron-rtd container:

You may choose to use the following neuron-rtd image: [790709498068.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/neuron-rtd:latest], or build your own image as shown in [Neuron Runtime Dockerfile](./Dockerfile.neuron-rtd).

Run neuron-rtd container as shown below. A volume must be mounted to :/sock where neuron-rtd will 
open a UDS socket. The application can interact with runtime using this socket.

```bash
$(aws ecr get-login --no-include-email --region us-east-1 --registry-ids 790709498068)
docker pull 790709498068.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/neuron-rtd:latest
docker tag 790709498068.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/neuron-rtd:latest neuron-rtd
mkdir /tmp/neuron_rtd_sock/
docker run --env AWS_NEURON_VISIBLE_DEVICES="0" --cap-add SYS_ADMIN --cap-add IPC_LOCK -v /tmp/neuron_rtd_sock/:/sock neuron-rtd
```


#### Step 2: Start application (tensorflow serving) container:

Build tensorflow-model-server-neuron image using provided example dockerfile [./Dockerfile.tf-serving]

Run assuming a compiled saved model was stored in s3://<my-bucket>/my_model/

```bash

# Note: the neuron-rtd socket directory must be mounted and pointed at using environment variable.
#       TensorFlow serving will use that socket to talk to Neuron-rtd
docker run --env NEURON_RTD_ADDRESS=unix:/sock/neuron.sock \
           -v /tmp/neuron_rtd_sock/:/sock \
           -p 8501:8501 \
           -p 8500:8500 \
           --env MODEL_BASE_PATH=s3://<my-bucket>/my_model/ \
           --env MODEL_NAME=my_model
           tensorflow-model-server-neuron

```

#### Step 3: Verify by running an inference!
