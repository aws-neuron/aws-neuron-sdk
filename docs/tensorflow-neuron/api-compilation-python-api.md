# Reference: TensorFlow-Neuron Compilation API

The Neuron compilation API for TensorFlow enables compilation of saved model to an Inferentia target.

## Method 

`tensorflow.neuron.saved_model.compile`

## Description

Within the graph or subgraph, the compile method selects and send Neuron-supported operations to Neuron-Compiler for compilation and saves the compiled artifacts in the graph.  More on Neuron-Compiler can be found here: TODO[link].

The compiled graph can be exported to saved model and served using TensorFlow Serving. Please see [Exporting for TensorFlow Serving](./tutorial-tensorflow-serving.md) for more information about exporting to saved model and serving using TensorFlow Serving.

## Arguments

* **model_dir:** The path of the original `SavedModel`.
* **new_model_dir:** The path to which the Neuron-optimized `SavedModel` will be stored.
* **batch_size:** (Optional) Positive integer representing batch size used in inference. The default value is 1.
* **model_shape_feed_dict:** (Optional) Dictionary {str: list} used for inferring tensor shapes. Keys should match model input names. Values are lists of positive integers representing model input tensor shapes.
* **model_feed_dict:** (Optional) Dictionary {str: numpy.array} used for inference. Useful for inferring tensor shapes. Keys should match model input names. Values are numpy arrays that can be fed as inputs to the `SavedModel`.
* **tags:** (Optional) Iterable of strings to identify the required `MetaGraphDef`. These should correspond to the tags used when saving the variables using the `SavedModel` `save()` API. Default is to use the first `tag_set` available in the `SavedModel`.
* **signature_def_key:** (Optional) String specifying the `signature_def` to use. Default is to use 'serving_default' or the first `signature_def` corresponding to `tags`.
* **minimum_segment_size:** (Optional) Integer indicating the minimum number of operations in an NeuronOp.
* **no_fuse_ops:** (Optional) None or iterable of strings (unordered) representing names of operations that are forcibly placed on CPU.
* **compiler_args:** (Optional) List of strings representing neuron-cc compiler arguments. Note that these arguments apply to all subgraphs generated by whitelist partitioning.
* **compiler_workdir:** (Optional) String representing work directory of the neuron-cc compiler.

## Returns

* Dictionary with operator counts before/after optimization.

## Example Usage

```python
import shutil
import tensorflow.neuron as tfn
saved_model_path = "<saved model path>"
compiled_saved_model_path = "<compiled saved model path>"
shutil.rmtree(compiled_saved_model_path, ignore_errors=True)
tfn.saved_model.compile(saved_model_path, compiled_saved_model_path)
```
