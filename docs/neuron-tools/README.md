# Identifying Neuron Devices

To identify number of Neuron Devices in a given instance use the `neuron-ls` command.

```
$ neuron-ls
+--------+--------+--------+-----------+--------------+---------+---------+---------+
| NEURON | NEURON | NEURON | CONNECTED |     PCI      | RUNTIME | RUNTIME | RUNTIME |
| DEVICE | CORES  | MEMORY |  DEVICES  |     BDF      | ADDRESS |   PID   | VERSION |
+--------+--------+--------+-----------+--------------+---------+---------+---------+

```

The above output is taken from an Inf1.6xlarge instance.
- NEURON DEVICE     ->  Logical ID assigned to the NeuronDevice. This id can be used when configuring multiple runtimes to use different NeuronDevices.
- NEURON CORES      ->  Number of NeuronCores present in the NeuronDevice.
- NEURON MEMORY     ->  Amount DRAM memory in NeuronDevice.
- CONNECTED DEVICES ->  Shows other NeuronDevices connected to this NeuronDevice. 
- PCI BDF           ->  PCI Bus Device Function (BDF) ID of the device.
- RUNTIME ADDRESS   ->  Shows address of runtime process using this NeuronDevice.
- RUNTIME PID       ->  Shows process id of runtime process using this NeuronDevice.
- RUNTIME VERSION   ->  Shows version of runtime process using this NeuronDevice.

# NeuronCore Groups
Multiple NeuronCores(NC) can be combined to form a NeuronCore Group (NCG).
Neuron framework layer will automatically create a default NeuronCore Group.
To view list of available NCGs the following command can be used.
```
$ neuron-cli list-ncg
Device count 4 NC count 16
Found 4 NCG's
+--------+----------+--------------------+----------------+
| NCG ID | NC COUNT | DEVICE START INDEX | NC START INDEX |
+--------+----------+--------------------+----------------+
|      1 |        2 |                  0 |              0 |
|      2 |        4 |                  0 |              2 |
|      3 |        3 |                  1 |              2 |
|      4 |        1 |                  2 |              1 |
+--------+----------+--------------------+----------------+
```
The above examples shows there are 4 NCGs created on the system with the following grouping
NCG ID 1: Device0:(Core0, Core1)
NCG ID 2: Device0:(Core2, Core3), Device1:(Core0, Core1)
NCG ID 3: Device1:(Core2, Core3), Device2:(Core0)
NCG ID 2: Device1:(Core1)

# Listing Models
Multiple models can be loaded into a single NCG, but only one can be in READY state at any given moment.
Inference can be performed only on models in the READY state.

The `neuron-cli list-model` command should be used to view all the models.
```
$ neuron-cli list-model

```

- UUID          ->  UUID generated for this model during compile time.
- MODEL ID      ->  Neuron Runtime identifier for this model.
- MODEL STATUS  ->  READY   = The model is loaded on to the NeuronDevice and active on the NeuronCore. (Inference can be done only on models with READY state)
                    STANDBY = The model is loaded on to the NeuronDevice but another model is currently active on the NeuronCore. (A model switch is needed to start inference)

# View Resource Usage
Each model loaded consumes a different amount of memory (host and device), NeuronCore and CPU usage.
The `neuron-top` command can be used to view the memory and NeuronCore usage.

```
$ neuron-top

In the above output:
- Model ID      ->  Unique Identifier for models loaded in the NeuronDevice
- Model Name    ->  Neuron Compiler Version-compiler work directory/User defined model name
- Node ID       ->  For Internal use only
- UUID          ->  Unique Id assigned by the Neuron Compiler for a Model
- Exec. Unit    ->  BDF of Neuron Device followed by the Neuron Core ID, b:d:f.NC
- Host Mem      ->  Host memory consumed by the Model in bytes
- Device Mem    ->  NeuronDevice memory consumed by the Model in bytes
- Neuron Core % ->  Utilization % of the neuron core at sample time.  If there are no active inferences this value will be 0.
