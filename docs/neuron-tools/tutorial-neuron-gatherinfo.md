# Tutorial: Using Neuron GatherInfo Tool to collect debug and support information

The Neuron GatherInfo tool  `neuron-gatherinfo.py`  can assist in automating the collection and packaging of information from Neuron SDK tools that is useful to both user and AWS for issue resolution. The tool gathers log files and other system information. If being used to supply that info to AWS, the tool will redact proprietary and confidential information. 
The GatherInfo tool is supplied in source code form - available here: [Neuron Gatherinfo](../../src/neuron-gatherinfo)

The tool enables developers to gather compiler and inference/runtime logs. Additionally, the common usage is from within one of the supported ML frameworks that have been integrated with Neuron, and information can be captured from those compile/runtime environments using the frameworks.

### Steps Overview:

1. Obtain a copy of neuron-gatherinfo.py from TODO<insert github link>
2. Install into a location in your $PATH or into a location from where you can launch the script
3. Use with compile and/or runtime environments

## Neuron-CC information gathering

### Step 1: Re-run the compile steps for your workload with increased verbosity or debug levels

* For TensorFlow-Neuron, change the Python code as shown. Note that  ‘compiler-workdir’ is expected to be an empty directory to prevent files from other runs from interfering with the information gathering. The call to the compile function has to be augmented with the **verbose** and the **compiler_workdir **arguments. In addition, please capture the stdout messages into a file (for example, by redirecting the stdout to a file)

```
tfn.saved_model.compile(model_dir, compiled_model_dir, compiler_args=['--verbose', '2', '--pipeline', 'compile',  'SaveTemps'], compiler_workdir='./compiler-workdir')

```

* For MXNet-Neuron, add compiler arguments as shown below and run the compilation process from an empty workdir:

```
import os
os.environ['SUBGRAPH_INFO'] = '1'
compile_args = { '--verbose' : 2, '--pipeline' : 'compile', 'flags' : ['SaveTemps'] }
csym, cargs, cauxs = neuron.compile(sym, args, auxs, inputs, **compile_args)
```

### Step 2: Run neuron-gatherinfo.py to gather information to share 

The output result will be a tar.gz file.

## Neuron Runtime information gathering

### Step 1: EXECUTE  inference steps for your workload with increased verbosity or debug levels

In the case of runtime information, the tool **neuron-dump.py** is used by **neuron-gatherinfo.py **to gather that information. Make sure that you have the neuron tools package (aws-neuron-tools) installed. 

### Step 2: Run neuron-gatherinfo.py to gather information to share 

The output result will be a tar.gz file.

# Tool Usage Reference

Run neuron-gatherinfo.py using the “—help“ option:

```
bash $ ~/bin/neuron-gatherinfo.py --help
usage: neuron-gatherinfo.py [-h] [--additionalfileordir ADDFLDIR] [-c CCDIR]
                            [-i] [-f FILTERFILE] [-m] -o OUTDIR [-r RTDIR] -s
                            STDOUT [-v]

    Usage: /home/user/bin/neuron-gatherinfo.py [options]
    This program is used to gather information from this system for analysis
    and debugging
    

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --additionalfileordir ADDFLDIR
                        Additional file or directory that the user wants to
                        provide in the archive. The user can sanitize this
                        file or directory before sharing
  -c CCDIR, --compileroutdir CCDIR
                        Location of the neuron-cc generated files
  -i, --include         By default, only the lines containing (grep) patterns
                        like 'nrtd|neuron|kernel:' from the syslog are copied.
                        Other lines are excluded. Using this option allows the
                        timestamp section of other lines to be included. The
                        rest of the contents of the line itself are elided.
                        Providing the timestamp section may provide time
                        continuity while viewing the copied syslog file
  -f FILTERFILE, --filter FILTERFILE
  -m, --modeldata       By using this option, the entire compiler work
                        directory's contents will be included (excluding the
                        .pb files, unless an additional option is used). This
                        would include model information, etc. The files that
                        are included, by default, are these: graph_def.neuron-
                        cc.log, all_metrics.csv, hh-tr-operand-
                        tensortensor.json
  -o OUTDIR, --out OUTDIR
                        The output directory where all the files and other
                        information will be stored. The output will be stored
                        as an archive as well as the actual directory where
                        all the contents are copied. This will allow a simple
                        audit of the files, if necessary. *** N O T E ***:
                        Make sure that this directory has enough space to hold
                        the files and resulting archive
  -r RTDIR, --runtimeoutdir RTDIR
                        Location of the neuron runtime generated files
  -s STDOUT, --stdout STDOUT
                        The file where the stdout of the compiler run was
                        saved
  -v, --verbose         Verbose mode displays commands executed and any
                        additional information which may be useful in
                        debugging the tool itself
           
           
```

# Examples

## Example 1: no ML model information gathered (default behavior)

In this case, the tool will archive just the default information gathering:

```
bash $ sudo ~/bin/neuron-gatherinfo.py   -o compile-and-run-info-for-debugging-no-model-info  -i --verbose  -s stdout-from-compile_resnet50.out -c compiler-workdir

Running cmd: lscpu and capturing output in file: /home/user/tutorials-3/compile-and-run-info-for-debugging-no-model-info/neuron-gatherinfo/report-lscpu.txt
Running cmd: lshw and capturing output in file: /home/user/tutorials-3/compile-and-run-info-for-debugging-no-model-info/neuron-gatherinfo/report-lshw.txt
Running cmd: lspci | grep -i Amazon and capturing output in file: /home/user/tutorials-3/compile-and-run-info-for-debugging-no-model-info/neuron-gatherinfo/report-lspci.txt
Running cmd: neuron-cc --version and capturing output in file: /home/user/tutorials-3/compile-and-run-info-for-debugging-no-model-info/neuron-gatherinfo/report-neuron-cc.txt
Running cmd: neuron-ls and capturing output in file: /home/user/tutorials-3/compile-and-run-info-for-debugging-no-model-info/neuron-gatherinfo/report-neuron-ls.txt
<SNIP>

    Archive created at:
        /home/user/tutorials-3/compile-and-run-info-for-debugging-no-model-info/neuron-gatherinfo.tar.gz
    From directory:
        /home/user/tutorials-3/compile-and-run-info-for-debugging-no-model-info/neuron-gatherinfo
    ******



```

##  Example 2 : model ML information gathered  using the “—modeldata” option

In this case, the tool will archive the compiler work directory in addition to the default information gathering

```
bash $ sudo ~/bin/neuron-gatherinfo.py   -o compile-and-run-info-for-debugging  -i --verbose  -s stdout-from-compile_resnet50.out -c compiler-workdir --modeldata

<SNIP>

Running cmd: lshw and capturing output in file: /home/user/tutorials-3/compile-and-run-info-for-debugging/neuron-gatherinfo/report-lshw.txt
Running cmd: lspci | grep -i Amazon and capturing output in file: /home/user/tutorials-3/compile-and-run-info-for-debugging/neuron-gatherinfo/report-lspci.txt
Running cmd: neuron-cc --version and capturing output in file: /home/user/tutorials-3/compile-and-run-info-for-debugging-no-model-info/neuron-gatherinfo/report-neuron-cc.txt
Running cmd: neuron-ls and capturing output in file: /home/user/tutorials-3/compile-and-run-info-for-debugging-no-model-info/neuron-gatherinfo/report-neuron-ls.txt

        /home/user/tutorials-3/compile-and-run-info-for-debugging/neuron-gatherinfo
    ******


    **************************
    Based on your command line option, we're also packaging these files:

        graph_def.neuron-cc.log
        all_metrics.csv
        hh-tr-operand-tensortensor.json

    And this directory: /home/user/tutorials-3/compiler-workdir
