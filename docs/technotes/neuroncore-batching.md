# Tech Note: Batching

Batching refers to the process of grouping multiple inference requests together and processing them as a group. Batching is typically used as an optimization for throughput at the expense of higher latency. Batching is usually implemented on a layer-by-layer basis, which allows for each set of weights in a given layer to be reused for each inference in the batch before needing to retrieve additional new weights. This enables Neuron to better amortize the cost of reading weights from the external memory (i.e. read weights from the memory once, and use them in multiple calculations), and thus improve the overall hardware efficiency.

The concept of batched inference is illustrated in the example below, with a single NeuronCore performing batched computation of a 3 layer neural network with a batch-size of 4. The NeuronCore reads weights from the external memory, and then performs the corresponding computations for all 4 inference-requests, before reading the next set of weights, thus better amortizing the cost of reading the weights from the memory.

Neuron uses an ahead-of-time compiler, so to enable batching in Neuron, a model should be explicitly compiled for a target batch-size by setting the input-tensor batch dimension accordingly. Users are encouraged to evaluate multiple batch sizes, in order to determine the optimal latency/throughput deployment-point (which is model/application dependent).

During inference, dynamic batching can be used to process a larger client-side inference batch-size, and allow the framework to automatically break up the user-batch into smaller batch sizes, to match the compiled batch-size. This technique increases the achievable throughput by hiding the framework-to-neuron overhead, and amortizing it over a larger batch size. To enable dynamic batching in TensorFlow, user would set the argument `dynamic_batch_size=True` during call to `tfn.saved_model.compile` method.

For example, the TensorFlow code snippet below enables batching, with dynamic-batching and a batch-size of N=4 when compiling a model to Inferentia target:

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow.neuron as tfn

# To change the batch size, change the first dimension in example_input
batch_sz = 4
example_input = np.zeros([batch_sz, 224, 224, 3], dtype='float16')

# Note: Users should temporarily use the following compilation flags when
# batch size is larger than 1. These flags are only applicable to CNNs
# (ResNet50 and similar models) and will be deprecated in the future.
compiler_args = ['--batching_en', '--rematerialization_en', '--spill_dis',
                 '--sb_size', str((batch_sz + 6)*10),
                 '--enable-replication', 'True']

tfn.saved_model.compile("rn50_fp16",
                        "rn50_fp16_compiled/1",
                        model_feed_dict={'input_1:0': example_input },
                        dynamic_batch_size=True,
                        compiler_args=compiler_args)
```

The following TensorFlow code snippet shows that the model can accept inference requests with arbitrary batch size:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow.neuron as tfn

predictor = tf.contrib.predictor.from_saved_model("rn50_fp16_compiled/1")
rt_batch_sz_list = [1, 4, 7, 8, 1024]
for rt_batch_sz in rt_batch_sz_list:
    example_input = np.zeros([rt_batch_sz, 224, 224, 3], dtype='float16')
    model_feed_dict = {'input_1:0': example_input}
    result = predictor(model_feed_dict)
```

**Note 1:** Users should temporarily use the following compilation flags when batch size is larger than 1: `--batching_en --rematerialization_en --spill_dis --sb_size <(batch_size + 6)*10> --enable-replication=True`. These flags are only applicable to CNNs (ResNet50 and similar models) and will be deprecated in the future.

**Note 2:** Depending on the neural network size, Neuron will have a maximum batch size that works optimally on Inferentia. Currently, FP16 ResNet50 is supported up to batch 5 only. Additionally, ResNet50 with FP32 input is limited to batch 1 only. These limitations are being addressed and will be fixed in a future releases of the compiler.  If a unsupported batch size is used, an internal compiler error message will be displayed (see [Known Issues](./performance-tuning.md#known-issues)).
