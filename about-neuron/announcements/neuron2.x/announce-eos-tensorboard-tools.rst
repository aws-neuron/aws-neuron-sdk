Announcing End of Support for TensorBoard Plugin for Neuron Profiler in Neuron 2.27
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Neuron 2.27 will be the last release to support TensorBoard Plugin. Future Neuron releases will not include the support for TensorBoard plugin. All customers using the TensorBoard plugin to visualize and analyze model performance are recommended to migrate to Neuron Explorer. 

To begin using Neuron Explorer (available since Neuron 2.27) for profiling, see :doc:`the Neuron Explorer documentation </tools/neuron-explorer/index>`. Neuron Explorer was introduced with :doc:`the release of the AWS Neuron SDK version 2.27.0 </release-notes/2.27.0/index>`.
