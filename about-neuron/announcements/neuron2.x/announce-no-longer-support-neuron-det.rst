Neuron no longer includes support for Neuron DET tool starting with this release 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Starting with :ref:`Neuron Release 2.22 <neuron-2.22.0-whatsnew>`, Neuron no longer supports the Neuron Distributed Event Tracing (NDET/neuron-det) tool.

We recommend customers transition to the Neuron Profiler 2.0 for debugging runtime hangs and issues in large-scale settings. This tool offers the same runtime function level traces with improved ease of use and optimized performance. For more information about the Neuron Profiler 2.0, see :ref:`neuron-profiler-2-0-guide`.
