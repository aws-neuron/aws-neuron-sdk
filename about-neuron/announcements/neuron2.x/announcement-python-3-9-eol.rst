Neuron no longer supports Python 3.9 starting with Neuron version 2.27
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Starting with Neuron Release 2.27, Neuron no longer includes support for Python 3.9 as it has reached its end-of-life status.

If you currently use Python 3.9, you are advised to migrate to a Neuron supported Python version (3.10, 3.11 or 3.12) to avoid security issues and bugs.

For a list of supported Python versions according to Neuron package, refer to :doc:`the list of current Neuron-supported package and library versions </release-notes/releasecontent>`.
