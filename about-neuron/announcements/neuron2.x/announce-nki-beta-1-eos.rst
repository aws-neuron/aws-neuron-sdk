Announcing end-of-support for NKI Beta 1 
------------------------------------------

AWS Neuron will no longer support NKI Beta 1 after Neuron v2.27.0. Since NKI Beta 1 is a beta feature, no support will be provided after the next major release. Customers will be asked to migrate to NKI Beta 2 for continued support. If you are using Beta 1, we encourage you to upgrade to Beta 2 with the release of Neuron v2.27.0.
