----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Starting with the release of Neuron 2.27.0, the ``tensorflow_2_10`` single framework Deep Learning AMI (DLAMI) and the TensorFlow 2.10 virtual environment in multi-framework DLAMIs are no longer supported.

Users are advised to use previously released DLAMIs for TensorFlow 2.10 support, or migrate to newer supported TensorFlow versions. For more information on supported versions, refer to :doc:`the list of current Neuron-supported package and library versions </release-notes/releasecontent>`.
