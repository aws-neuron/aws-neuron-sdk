Neuron no longer supports PyTorch 2.6 starting with Neuron 2.27
---------------------------------------------------------------

Starting with Neuron 2.27, Neuron no longer supports PyTorch 2.6. We recommend that all customers using PyTorch 2.6 to upgrade to the latest supported PyTorch version.

Customers currently using PyTorch 2.6 must upgrade to a newer supported PyTorch version. For more information on supported versions, refer to :doc:`the list of current Neuron-supported package and library versions </release-notes/releasecontent>`.
