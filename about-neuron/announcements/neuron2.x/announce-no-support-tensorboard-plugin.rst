Neuron no longer supports TensorBoard Plugin for Neuron Profiler starting with Neuron 2.28
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Starting with Neuron 2.28, Neuron no longer supports TensorBoard Plugin for Neuron Profiler. All customers using TensorBoard Plugin to visualize and analyze model performance are recommended to migrate to Neuron Explorer.

To start using Neuron Explorer (available since Neuron 2.27) to profile your workloads, please see the :doc:`Neuron Explorer Getting Started guide </tools/neuron-explorer/get-started>`.
