Introduction
------------
The kernel provides a few ways in which userspace programs can get system information from the kernel space. Sysfs is one common way to do so. It is a virtual filesystem typically mounted on the ``/sys`` directory and contains information about hardware devices attached to the system and about drivers handling those devices. By navigating the hierarchical structure of the sysfs filesystem and viewing the information provided by its files and directories, you can gather valuable information that can help diagnose and resolve a wide range of hardware and system issues.

Thus a sysfs filesystem is set up per Neuron Device under ``/sys/devices/virtual/neuron_device`` to give you an insight into the Neuron Driver and Runtime at system level. By performing several simple CLIs such as reading or writing to a sysfs file, you can get information such as Runtime status, memory usage, Driver info etc. You can even create your own shell scripts to query Runtime and Driver statistics from sysfs and generate customized reports.

This user guide will first explain the Neuron sysfs structure and then introduce many ways where you can perform diagnostic works with Neuron sysfs.

Each Neuron Device is represented as a directory under ``/sys/devices/virtual/neuron_device/``, where ``neuron0/`` represents the Neuron Device 0, ``neuron1/`` represents the Neuron Device 1, etc. Each NeuronCore is represented as a directory under a Neuron Device directory, represented as ``neuron_core{0,1,2,...}``. Metrics such as Runtime and Driver info and statistics are collected as per NeuronCore in two directories under the NeuronCore directory, i.e. ``info/`` and ``stats/``.

Most of the metrics belong to a category called “counter.” 
Each counter is represented as a directory, which holds two numerical values as two files: total and present. Each memory usage counter has an additional value called peak.
The total value starts accumulating metrics when the Driver is loaded. The present value records the last changed metric value. The peak value records the max value so far.
Each counter has the same filesystem structure like this:

.. code-block:: dash

    /sys/devices/virtual/neuron_device/neuron0/neuron_core0/status/
    ├── exec_bad_input/
    │   ├── total
    │   └── present
    ├── hw_error/
    │   ├── total
    │   └── present
    ├── infer_failed_to_queue/
    │   ├── total
    │   └── present
    └── ...



Description for Each Field
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``info/``: This directory stores general information about hardware and software. None of them are counter types.

* ``notify_delay``: The delay between notifications from the Neuron Device.  Current settings are on (``0``) or off (``-1``).  Off by default. 

* ``serial_number``: The unique device identifier.

* ``architecture/``: This directory stores hardware architecture information.

  * ``arch_type``: The architecture type of the Neuron Device. Sample architecture types are v1, v2, and v3. You can only read the value. You cannot change it.

  * ``instance_type``: The instance type of the Neuron Device. Sample instance types are Inf1, Inf2, and Trn1. You can only read the value. You cannot change it.

  * ``device_type``: The Neuron Device type. Sample Neuron Device types are Inferentia, Inferentia2, and Trainium1. You can only read the value. You cannot change it.


``stats/``: This directory stores Neuron Runtime and Driver statistics. It contains three subdirectories: ``status/``, ``memory_usage/``, and ``other_info/``.

* ``status/``: This directory stores the number of each return status of API calls. As explained in :ref:`The LIBNRT API Return Codes <nrt_api>`, every API call returns an NRT_STATUS value, which represents the return status of that API call. Our sysfs filesystem stores all ``NRT_STATUS`` as subdirectories under the ``status/`` directory. They all have the counter structure. Thus each ``NRT_STATUS`` subdirectory holds two values (total and present) and records the number of times you receive a certain ``NRT_STATUS``. The following is description for each ``NRT_STATUS`` subdirectory. You should see the description align with what is described in :ref:`The LIBNRT API Return Codes <nrt_api>`.

* ``memory_usage/``: This directory contains memory usage statistics for both device and host, represented as counters. In this directory, the total counters indicate the current memory usage, present counters represent the memory allocation or deallocation amount in the previous operation, and peak counters indicate the maximum memory usage observed. Additionally, this directory provides detailed breakdown statistics for device and host memory usage. These memory breakdown details correspond to the :ref:`Memory Usage Summary <neuron_top_mem_usage>` section displayed on in Neuron Monitor.

  * ``device_mem/``: The amount of memory that Neuron Runtime uses for weights, instructions and DMA rings.

    * This device memory per NeuronCore is further categorized into five types: ``collectives/``, ``constants/``, ``dma_rings/``, ``driver_memory/``, ``model_code/``, ``model_shared_scratchpad/``, ``nonshared_scratchpad/``, ``notifications/``, ``runtime_memory/``, ``tensors/``, and ``uncategorized/``. Each of these categories has total, present, and peak.
        * ``collectives`` - amount of device memory used for collective communication between workers
        * ``constants`` - amount of device memory used for constants (for applications running training) or weights (for applications running inferences)
        * ``dma_rings`` - amount of device memory used for storing model executable code used for data movements
        * ``driver_memory`` - amount of device memory used by the Neuron Driver
        * ``model_code`` - amount of device memory used for storing model executable code
        * ``model_shared_scratchpad`` - amount of device memory used for the shared model scratchpad, a buffer shared between models on the same Neuron Core used for internal model variables and other auxiliary buffers
        * ``nonshared_scratchpad`` - amount of device memory used for non-shared model scratchpad, a buffer used by a single model for internal model variables and other auxiliary buffers
        * ``notifications`` - amount of device memory used to store instruction level trace information used to profile workloads ran on the device
        * ``runtime_memory`` - amount of device memory used by the Neuron Runtime (outside of the previous categories)
        * ``tensors`` - amount of device memory used for tensors
        * ``uncategorized`` - amount of device memory that does not belong in any other catagory in this list
  
  * ``host_mem/``: The amount of memory that Neuron Runtime uses for input and output tensors.

    * The host memory per Neuron Device is further categorized into four types: ``application_memory/``, ``constants/``, ``dma_buffers/``, ``dma_rings/``, ``driver_memory/``, ``notifications/``, ``tensors/``, ``uncategorized/``.  These categories provide more granular host memory classification compared to :ref:`Host Used Memory <neuron_top_host_mem_usage>` section. Each of these categories has total, present, and peak

  * ``hardware/``: Hardware statistics.

    * ``mem_ecc_uncorrected``: The number of unrepairable uncorrected ECC events in the Neuron device's DRAM.

    * ``mem_ecc_repairable_uncorrected``: The number of repairable uncorrected ECC events in the Neuron device's DRAM.

    * ``sram_ecc_uncorrected``: The  number of uncorrected ECC events in the Neuron device's SRAM.
  * ``power/``: Power statistics.

    * ``utilization``: Reports per-minute power usage statistics as a percentage of max power in the following format:

        <status>,<timestamp>,<min_power>,<max_power>,<avg_power>

        **Field descriptions:**

        status
            Indicates the sampling state in a string.  Valid values are:

              ``POWER_STATUS_VALID`` - Sampling successful

              ``POWER_STATUS_NO_DATA`` - No samples available

              ``POWER_STATUS_INVALID`` - An internal sampling error occurred

        timestamp
            Time when the sample was collected in Unix epoch seconds (integer)

        min_power
            Minimum power utilization during the sampling period (0.00-100.00%)

        max_power
            Maximum power utilization during the sampling period (0.00-100.00%)

        avg_power
            Average power utilization during the sampling period (0.00-100.00%)

      The interface updates these statistics every minute based on continuous power sampling.
* ``other_info/``: This directory contains statistics that are not included by ``status/`` and ``memory_usage/``. None of them are counter types.

  * ``flop_count``: The number of flops. You can use it to calculate the TFLOP/s by ``flop_count`` / time interval

  * ``inference_count``: The number of successful inferences

  * ``model_load_count``:  The number of successful model loads

  * ``reset_fail_count``: The number of failed device resets

  * ``reset_req_count``:  The number of device resets requests

  * ``nc_time_in_use``:  The time interval in microseconds between the start and the end of the current execution on hardware

Other fields:

* ``connected_devices``: The list of connected devices' ids. You should see the same output as neuron-ls's CONNECTED DEVICES.

* ``reset``: write to this file resets corresponding the Neuron Device.


Read and Write to Sysfs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Reading a sysfs file gives the value for the corresponding metric. You can use the cat command to view the contents of the sysfs files.: 

.. code-block:: bash

  ubuntu@ip-xxx-xx-xx-xxx:~$ sudo cat /sys/devices/virtual/neuron_device/neuron0/neuron_core0/stats/status/failure/total 
  0
  ubuntu@ip-xxx-xx-xx-xxx:~$ sudo cat /sys/devices/virtual/neuron_device/neuron0/neuron_core0/info/architecture/arch_type 
  NCv2

Sysfs metrics of counter type are write to clear. You can write any value to the file, and the metric will be set to 0:

.. code-block:: bash

  ubuntu@ip-xxx-xx-xx-xxx:~$ echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/devices/virtual/neuron_device/neuron0/neuron_core0/stats/status/failure/total 
  1


Writing to ``reset`` resets the corresponding Neuron Device. E.g. the below resets Neuron Device 0:

.. code-block:: bash

  ubuntu@ip-xxx-xx-xx-xxx:~$ echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/devices/virtual/neuron_device/neuron0/reset
  1

Note
^^^^

All files under ``/sys/devices/virtual/neuron_device/neuron0/power`` such as ``runtime_active_kids`` or ``runtime_status`` are related to generic device power management. They are not created or controlled by our sysfs metrics. The word ``runtime`` in these files does not refer to Neuron Runtime.

.. _troubleshoot_via_sysfs:
How to Troubleshoot via Sysfs
-----------------------------
You can perform simple and easy tasks to troubleshoot your ML jobs with one or a few CLIs to read or write the sysfs filesystem.
You can do aggregations across all the NeuronCores and all the Neuron Device to get a summarized view using your scripts.


You can also use the Sysfs notification feature to wait passively (without wasting CPU cycles) for changes to the values of Sysfs files. To use this feature, you need to implement a user-space program that calls the poll() function on the Sysfs file that you want to wait on. 
The poll() function has the following signature: ``unsigned int (*poll) (struct file *, struct poll_table_struct *)``.
By default, the Sysfs notification feature is turned off when the driver is loaded. To enable notifications, you can set the value of ``/sys/devices/virtual/neuron_device/neuron0/info/notify_delay`` to 0. To disable notifications, you can set it to -1. Please note that enabling this feature can impact performance.

Here is a sample user space program using poll():

.. code-block:: dash

	#include <fcntl.h>
	#include <poll.h>
	#include <unistd.h>
	#include <stdio.h>
	#include <stdlib.h>

	int main(int argc, char * argv[])
	{
		char readbuf[128];
		int attr_fd = -1; 
		struct pollfd pfd;
		int retval = 0;
		ssize_t read_bytes;

		if (argc < 2) {
			fprintf(stderr, "Error: Please specify sysfs file path\n");
			exit(1);
		}   
		attr_fd = open(argv[1], O_RDONLY, 0); 
		if (attr_fd < 0) {
			perror(argv[1]);
			exit(2);
		}   

		read_bytes = read(attr_fd, readbuf, sizeof(readbuf));
		if (read_bytes < 0) {
			perror(argv[1]);
			exit(3);
		}   
		printf("%.*s", (int)read_bytes, readbuf);

		pfd.fd = attr_fd;
		pfd.events = POLLERR | POLLPRI;
		pfd.revents = 0;
		while ((retval = poll(&pfd, 1, 100)) >= 0) {
			if (pfd.revents & (POLLERR | POLLPRI)) {
				pfd.revents = 0;

				lseek(attr_fd, 0, SEEK_SET);
				read_bytes = read(attr_fd, readbuf, sizeof(readbuf));
				if (read_bytes < 0) {
					perror(argv[1]);
					exit(4);
				}
				printf("%.*s", (int)read_bytes, readbuf);
			}
		}
		return 0;
	}
