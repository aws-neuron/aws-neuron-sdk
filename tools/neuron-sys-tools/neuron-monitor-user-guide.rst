=========================

Overview
--------

**neuron-monitor** collects metrics and stats from the Neuron
Applications running on the system and streams the collected data to
``stdout`` in ``JSON`` format. It is provided as part of the
``aws-neuron-tools`` package.

These metrics and stats are organized into **metric groups** which can
be configured by providing a configuration file as described in :ref:`using-neuron-monitor`

When running, **neuron-monitor** will:

-  Collect the data for the metric groups which, based on the elapsed
   time since their last update, need to be updated
-  Take the newly collected data and consolidate it into a large report
-  Serialize that report to JSON and stream it to stdout from where it
   can be consumed by other tools - such as the sample
   `neuron-monitor-cloudwatch.py <#neuron-monitor-cloudwatchpy>`__ and
   `neuron-monitor-prometheus.py <#neuron-monitor-prometheuspy>`__
   scripts.
-  Wait until at least one **metric group** needs to be collected and
   repeat this flow

.. note::

  ``neuron-monitor`` fully supports the newly launched inf2 instances.

Using neuron-monitor
--------------------

.. _monitor_cli:

.. rubric:: neuron-monitor CLI

.. program:: neuron-monitor

.. option:: neuron-monitor [parameters]

    neuron-monitor accepts the following optional parameters:

    - :option:`--verbose` (int) default=0: Can be 0 to 4, and controls the amount of
      debugging and verbose information sent to stderr; **0: no output**,
      **4: maximum verbosity**

    - :option:`-c, --config-file` (string): Allows specifying a valid path to a
      neuron-monitor JSON configuration file


**Example:**

.. code-block::

    neuron-monitor -c monitor.conf


Not specifying any configuration file will enable collecting all the metric groups
with a period of 5 seconds for all currently running Neuron applications.

Configuration file example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Example of a configuration file which enables all available **metric
groups** for every running Neuron application, with a global update period of 1
second and sets an update period of 2 seconds for the ``"neuron_hw_counters"``
metric group:

::

   {
     "period": "1s",
     "neuron_runtimes": [
       {
         "tag_filter": ".*",
         "metrics": [
           {
             "type": "neuroncore_counters"
           },
           {
             "type": "memory_used"
           },
           {
             "type": "neuron_runtime_vcpu_usage"
           },
           {
             "type": "execution_stats"
           }
         ]
       }
     ],
     "system_metrics": [
       {
         "type": "vcpu_usage"
       },
       {
         "type": "memory_info"
       },
       {
          "period": "2s",
          "type": "neuron_hw_counters"
       }
     ]
   }

Neuron applications tagging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In order to make application monitoring easier, Neuron applications can be tagged with a 255 character
string which identifies that app. Tagging is done using the ``NEURON_PROCESS_TAG`` environment variable.

For example:
``NEURON_PROCESS_TAG=my_app_1 python training.py`` will associate the ``my_app_1`` tag with that Python application.
If ``NEURON_PROCESS_TAG`` is not specified, the application's PID will be used as a TAG.

This tag will be used by neuron-monitor to filter Neuron applications.

JSON objects and fields in the configuration file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  ``"neuron_runtimes"`` - array of objects specifying which Neuron
   Applications to monitor and what metric groups are enabled for each
   of them

   -  ``"tag_filter"`` - a regex which will be used to filter Neuron applications tags
      in order to determine if they will be monitored (optional)
   -  ``"metrics"`` - array of objects specifying which metric groups to
      capture for this Neuron application

      -  ``"type"`` - type of metric group

-  ``"period"`` - this field applies to **metric group** objects and
   sets the amount of time between two updates for that metric group

   -  if can be specified as part of the **root** and/or
      **neuron_runtime** objects where it applies to all their children,
      and/or as part of a **metric group** object
   -  if there's no period specified, a default value of **5 seconds**
      will be used

-  ``"system_metrics"`` - array of objects specifying which system level
   metric groups are enabled

Neuron Runtime-level metric groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  :ref:`neuron-monitor-nc-counters` - NeuronCore related metrics
-  :ref:`neuron-monitor-memory-used` - data on the amount of memory used
   by the Neuron application
-  :ref:`neuron-monitor-vcpu-usage` - Neuron application vCPU
   utilization data
-  :ref:`neuron-monitor-execution-stats` - Neuron application execution
   stats, including error count and latency

System-wide metric groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  :ref:`neuron-monitor-vcpu-usage` - system-wide vCPU usage
-  :ref:`neuron-monitor-memory-info` - system-wide memory usage
-  :ref:`neuron-monitor-hw-counters` - counters for correctable and
   uncorrectable memory ecc events


Execution model
---------------

|image|

neuron-monitor waits for one or more **metric groups** to be up for
update, then collects the corresponding data, consolidates it into a
report which is streamed to stdout as a JSON and goes back to waiting.

The JSON output format
----------------------

Whenever the report gets updated, a complete JSON is written to stdout.
This is its structure:

::

   {
     "neuron_runtime_data": [
       {
         "pid": 0,
         "address": "",
         "neuron_runtime_tag", "my_app_1",
         "error": "",
         "report": {
           "neuroncore_counters": {
               [...]
           },
           "execution_stats": {
               [...]
           },
           "memory_used": {
               [...]
           },
           "neuron_runtime_vcpu_usage": {
               [...]
           }
         }
       }
     ],
     "system_data": {
       "neuron_hw_counters": {
               [...]
       },
       "vcpu_usage": {
               [...]
       },
       "memory_info": {
               [...]
       }
     },
     "instance_info": {
               [...]
     },
     "neuron_hardware_info": {
               [...]
     }
   }

-  ``"neuron_runtime_data"`` is an array containing one entry per each
   Neuron application which passes the filter specified in the settings file

   -  ``"pid"`` is the pid of this Neuron application
   -  ``"neuron_runtime_tag"`` is the configured tag for the Neuron application
   -  ``"error"`` specifies any error that occurred when collecting data
      from this Neuron application
   -  ``"report"`` will contain the results for the Neuron application-level
      metric groups; their formats are described below

-  ``"system_data"`` has a similar structure to ``"neuron_runtime_data"``â€˜s
   ``"report"`` but only contains system-level metric groups (not
   associated to any Neuron application)


Regardless of the configuration, the following two JSON objects are always present
in the output:

**instance_info**
Contains information about the instance on which neuron-monitor is running.
::

     "instance_info": {
       "instance_name": "My_Instance",
       "instance_id": "i-0011223344556677a",
       "instance_type": "inf1.xlarge",
       "instance_availability_zone": "us-west-2b",
       "instance_availability_zone_id": "usw2-az2",
       "instance_region": "us-west-2",
       "ami_id": "ami-0011223344556677b",
       "subnet_id": "subnet-112233ee",
       "error": ""
     }

Depending on when the instance was launched, the following fields might
not be available:

-  ``instance_availability_zone_id`` : available only for instances
   launched in 2020-08-24 and later
-  ``instance_region`` : available only for instances launched on
   2020-08-24 and later
-  ``instance_name`` : available only if ``instance_region`` is set and
   aws-cli tools are installed

``error`` will contain an error string if getting one of the fields,
**except those mentioned above**, resulted in an error.

**neuron_hardware_info**
Contains basic information about the Neuron hardware.
::

     "neuron_hardware_info": {
       "neuron_device_type": "trainium",
       "neuroncore_version": "v2",
       "neuron_device_count": 16,
       "neuron_device_memory_size": 34359738368,
       "neuroncore_per_device_count": 2,
       "error": ""
     }

-  ``neuron_device_type``: type of the Neuron Devices on the instance
-  ``neuroncore_version``: version of the NeuronCores on the instance
-  ``neuron_device_count`` : number of available Neuron Devices
-  ``neuron_device_memory_size``: total memory available on each Neuron Device
-  ``neuroncore_per_device_count`` : number of NeuronCores present on each Neuron Device
-  ``error`` : will contain an error string if any occurred when getting this information
   (usually due to the Neuron Driver not being installed or not running).


Each **metric group** requested in the settings file will get an entry
in the resulting output. The general format for such an entry is:

::

   "metric_group": {
     "period": 1.015, // Actual captured period, in seconds
     "error": "",     // Error, if any occurred, otherwise an empty string
     [...]            // Metric group specific data
   }

Companion scripts
-----------------

neuron-monitor is installed with two example Python companion script:
`neuron-monitor-cloudwatch.py <#neuron-monitor-cloudwatchpy>`__ and
`neuron-monitor-prometheus.py <#neuron-monitor-prometheuspy>`__.

.. _neuron-monitor-cloudwatchpy:

neuron-monitor-cloudwatch.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It requires Python3 and the `boto3 Python
module <https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/quickstart.html#quickstart>`__.
It is installed to:
``/opt/aws/neuron/bin/neuron-monitor-cloudwatch.py``.

.. _using-neuron-monitor-cloudwatchpy:

Using neuron-monitor-cloudwatch.py
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

   neuron-monitor | neuron-monitor-cloudwatch.py --namespace <namespace> --region <region>

For example:

::

   neuron-monitor | neuron-monitor-cloudwatch.py --namespace neuron_monitor_test --region us-west-2

.. _neuron-monitor-prometheuspy:

neuron-monitor-prometheus.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It requires Python3 and the `Prometheus client Python
module <https://github.com/prometheus/client_python>`__. It is installed
to: ``/opt/aws/neuron/bin/neuron-monitor-prometheus.py``.

.. _using-neuron-monitor-prometheuspy:

Using neuron-monitor-prometheus.py
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

   neuron-monitor | neuron-monitor-prometheus.py --port <port>

For example:

::

   neuron-monitor | neuron-monitor-prometheus.py --port 8008

The default value for ``--port`` is ``8000``.

If your data visualization framework is Grafana, we provided a :download:`Grafana dashboard </src/examples/neuron-monitor/neuron-monitor-grafana.json>`
which integrates with Prometheus and this script.
