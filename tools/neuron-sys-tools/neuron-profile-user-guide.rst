Neuron Profile User Guide
=========================

.. contents:: Table of contents

Overview
--------

``neuron-profile`` is a tool to profile and analyze performance of a ML model compiled with the Neuron compiler
and run on NeuronDevices.

.. note::

    Please use the ``aws-neuronx-tools`` package from Neuron SDK 2.11 or higher.

``neuron-profile`` helps developers identify performance bottlenecks and optimize their workloads for NeuronDevices. neuron-profile provides insights into NeuronDevice activity including the instructions executed on each compute engine (ex. Tensor engine, Vector engine, etc.), DMA data movement activity, and performance metrics such as engine utilization, DMA throughput, memory usage, and more. NeuronDevice activity is collected by the ``neuron-profile capture`` command which runs the model with tracing enabled. Profiling typically has near zero overhead because NeuronDevices have dedicated on-chip hardware profiling.

Additionally, ``neuron-profile`` supports Neuron Kernel Interface (NKI) developers in profiling their kernels. For more information, please refer to :ref:`neuron_profile_for_nki`


.. note::
    This page refers to the existing Neuron Profiler feature set focused on capturing and
    viewing device profiles (hardware activity during graph execution on NeuronCores).
    Neuron Profiler 2.0 is a set of new features currently in beta that enhance and simplify 
    capturing and viewing profiles. It is not a replacement for the features described on this page. To learn 
    more about Neuron Profiler 2.0, please refer to the :ref:`Neuron Profiler 2.0 (Beta) User Guide <neuron-profiler-2-0-guide>`.

.. _neuron-profiler-installation:
Installation
------------

``neuron-profile`` comes as part of the ``aws-neuronx-tools`` package, and will be installed to ``/opt/aws/neuron/bin``.

The Neuron web profile viewer utilizes InfluxDB OSS 2.x to store time series data for the profiled workloads after post processing.
Please follow the instructions provided at https://portal.influxdata.com/downloads/ for the correct OS.  A sample installation
of Neuron Profile and InfluxDB is provided below.

Ubuntu

Capturing a profile
-------------------

The ``neuron-profile`` tool can both capture and post-process profiling information. ``neuron-profile`` takes a compiled model (a NEFF), executes it, and saves the profile results to a NTFF (``profile.ntff`` by default).
For this example, we assume a NEFF is already available as ``file.neff``

::

    $ neuron-profile capture -n file.neff -s profile.ntff

Capturing profiles for multi-worker jobs
----------------------------------------

``neuron-profile`` can capture profiles for collectives-enabled NEFFs running across multiple NeuronCores, NeuronDevices, or even nodes. 
This is useful for understanding performance and communication overheads when deploying larger distributed models.

The following example, performs a distributed run across all NeuronDevices and NeuronCores on an inf2.24xlarge instances, capturing profiles for all 12 workers (one for each NeuronCore).

::

    $ neuron-profile capture -n file.neff --collectives-workers-per-node 12 -s output/profile.ntff

A profile is saved for each worker in the output directory.

:: 

    $ ls output
    profile_rank_0.ntff   profile_rank_2.ntff  profile_rank_6.ntff profile_rank_1.ntff   profile_rank_3.ntff  profile_rank_7.ntff
    profile_rank_10.ntff  profile_rank_4.ntff  profile_rank_8.ntff profile_rank_11.ntff  profile_rank_5.ntff  profile_rank_9.ntff

It is also possible to run a distributed job while only capturing a profile for a specific worker instead of all workers. To do that, use the ``--collectives-profile-id`` option.

::

    $ neuron-profile capture -n file.neff --collectives-profile-id 5 --collectives-workers-per-node 12 -s output/profile.ntff
    $ ls output
    profile_rank_5.ntff


Capturing profiles for multi-node jobs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For multi-node jobs, ``neuron-profile`` must be invoked on each node using the ``collectives-worker-start-id`` to specify the global index of the first worker on the given
node. For example, for a two node job with a total of four workers and two workers per node, the following commands are run on each node.

::

    # on node 0
    $ neuron-profile capture -n file.neff --collectives-worker-start-id 0 --collectives-workers-per-node 2 --collectives-worker-count 4
    # on node 1
    $ neuron-profile capture -n file.neff --collectives-worker-start-id 2 --collectives-workers-per-node 2 --collectives-worker-count 4

``neuron-profile`` saves the profile for a worker on the node where that worker was launched. So in the case above, ``profile_rank_0.ntff`` and ``profile_rank_1.ntff``
are saved to node 0, and ``profile_rank_2.ntff`` and ``profile_rank_3.ntff`` are saved to node 1.



Processing and viewing the profile results
------------------------------------------

To analyze and view the collected profiling data, use the ``view`` subcommand of ``neuron-profile``. This command performs two main functions: it post-processes the profiling data and starts up an HTTP server. Once the server is running, you can access the profiling results through your web browser. Please note: Chrome is the officially supported browser for viewing profiling results


.. note::
    Profiles can be processed and viewed on another machine without Neuron devices. The ``aws-neuronx-tools`` package
    needs to be installed so that you can run ``neuron-profile view``. To process the profile on another
    instance, you need to copy the NEFF and NTFF files from your Inf or Trn instance to that instance.

Viewing a single profile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first way to invoke ``neuron-profile view`` is to pass both the NEFF and the NTFF to this command.
It will post-process these artifacts and print out a direct link to the profile view.

::

    $ neuron-profile view -n file.neff -s profile.ntff
    View profile at http://localhost:3001/profile/n_fdc71a0b582ee3009711a96e59958af921243921
    ctrl-c to exit


Viewing profiles for multi-worker jobs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Profiles from multi-worker jobs (i.e. more than one NeuronCore) can either be viewed individually or in a combined collectives view.
Since profile data is often similar between workers and processing profile data for all workers can be time-consuming, it is recommended to first 
explore the profile for a single worker or small subset of workers. Viewing the profile for a specific worker is the same as for single-worker profiles.

::

    $ neuron-profile view -n file.neff -s output/profile_rank_5.ntff
    View profile at http://localhost:3001/profile/n_fdc71a0b582ee3009711a96e59958af921243921


To view the profile for multiple workers, pass the directory containing all worker profiles to ``neuron-profile``.

::

    $ neuron-profile view -n file.neff -d output
    View profile at http://localhost:3001/profile_cc/p_9a69d907e1350100c9b03745eaa67aa7422842ed

|neuron-profile-multiworker-timeline|

When viewing profiles with the combined collectives view you can easily switch between the timelines of different workers by clicking
the "Rank <x>" tabs.

Note: the "CC Aggregated View" currently shows no data. This will be populated in an upcoming release. 


Viewing multiple profiles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alternatively, when post-processing multiple profiles, it may be desirable to have a persistent server running while processing results in the background.
In this case, we can skip passing arguments to the command, which will direct users to the main page listing all available profiles.

::

    $ neuron-profile view
    View a list of profiles at http://localhost:3001/

In a separate window, we can kick off the post-processing without launching another server by passing the ``--ingest-only`` flag.

::

    $ neuron-profile view -n file.neff -s profile.ntff --ingest-only
    Profile "n_47cf9972d42798d236caa68952d0d29a76d8bd66" is ready to view

``n_47cf9972d42798d236caa68952d0d29a76d8bd66`` is the bucket where the data is stored.  We can find this profile at ``localhost:3001/profile/<bucket>``.

Accessing the profiles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If ``neuron-profile view`` is run on a remote instance, you may need to use port forwarding to access the profiles.

From the local machine, SSH to the remote instance and forward ports 3001 (the default ``neuron-profile`` HTTP server port) and 8086 (the default
InfluxDB port).  Then in the browser, go to ``localhost:3001`` to view the profiles.

::

    $ ssh <user>@<ip> -L 3001:localhost:3001 -L 8086:localhost:8086


.. _neuron-profile-ug-alternative-outputs:

Alternative output formats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Besides the web view mentioned above, ``neuron-profile`` also supports other output formats such as ``summary-text`` and ``summary-json`` for viewing overall metrics of the profile,
as well as ``json`` for a parsable alternative.

Profile summary
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can see a summary of each profile using the command ``neuron-profile view --output-format summary-text -n file.neff -s output/profile_rank_<i>.ntff``. This output
includes summary metrics and fields for the NeuronCore (``nc_idx``) and NeuronDevice (``nd_idx``) on which the worker was run. For example, the following shows worker 5 used core 1 on
device 3 and took 0.017 seconds (17 ms) to run the model.

::

    $ neuron-profile view --output-format summary-text -n file.neff -s output/profile_rank_5.ntff | grep -e "nd_idx" -e "nc_idx" -e "total_time"
    nc_idx      1
    nd_idx      2
    total_time  0.017

This summary is also available as JSON using ``--output-format summary-json``.

JSON
^^^^

You can also view the profile summary and all post-processed profiler events together as a single JSON. To do that, use the ``--output-format json`` option.

::

    $ neuron-profile view --output-format json --output-file profile.json -n file.neff -s output/profile_rank_5.ntff
    $ cat profile.json
    {
        "summary": [
            {
                "total_time": 0.017,
                "event_count": 11215
                [...]
            }
        ],
        "instruction": [
            {
                "timestamp": 10261883214,
                "duration": 148,
                "label": "TensorMatrix",
                "hlo_name": "%add.1 = add(%dot, %custom-call.44)",
                "opcode": "MATMUL",
                "operands": "S[5] (Tensor)++@complete acc_flags=3 row_grp=q0 src=fp16@0x5600[1,0,0][3,1,1] dst=0x2000000[1,0,0][3,1,1] 3*128 "
            },
            [...]
        ]
    }

Understanding a Neuron profile
------------------------------

The section provides a quick overview on what features and information are available through the Neuron web profile viewer.

For more information on terms used, please check out the :ref:`neuron_hw_glossary`.

Timeline
~~~~~~~~

|neuron-profile-web-timeline|

The execution timeline is plotted based on the elapsed nanoseconds since the start of execution.

Starting from the bottom, the ``TensorMatrix Utilization`` shows the efficiency of the TensorEngine, and
the ``Pending DMA Count`` and ``DMA Throughput`` rows show the DMA activity.  In general, we want these to be as high
as possible, and in some cases may help give clues as to whether the workload is memory or compute bound.

Next are the individual NeuronCore engine executions.  These rows show the start and end times for instructions executed by each
engine, and clicking on one of these bars will show more detailed information, as well as any dependencies that were found.
For models involving collective compute operations, you will additionally see rows labeled with ``CC-core``, which are used to synchronize
the CC operations.

Towards the top is the DMA activity.  These can include the transfers of input and output tensors, intermediate tensors, and any
additional spilling or loading to and from the on-chip SRAM memory.


.. _neuron-profile-ug-features:

Features
~~~~~~~~

The following are some useful features that may help with navigating a profile:

- Dragging your cursor across a portion of the timeline will zoom in to the selected window, providing a more in depth view of the execution during that time period.
- Hovering over a point will reveal a subset of information associated with it.
- Clicking a point will open a text box below the timeline with all the information associated with it.
- Right-clicking a point will drop a marker at a certain location.  This marker will persist when zooming in and out.

  - All marker information can be found by clicking the ``Annotations`` button.
  - Markers can be saved and loaded by using a provided name for the marker set.
  - Individual markers can be renamed or deleted in this menu as well.
  - Time span between markers will automatically be shown, and users can change the marker name next to ``diff vs`` to calculate time between other markers.

|neuron-profile-annotation-menu|

- The "Search" tab can be used to find and highlight specific points in the profile related to the queried field(s).
- Click on the "Box Select" button in the top-right corner of the timeline and then click and drag on any region of the plot to select all events in that region and get summary statistics such as total duration and breakdowns of opcodes, transfer_sizes, and more.
- The ``Edit view settings`` can be used to further customize the timeline view.  Editing any settings will update the URL accordingly, which can be used to re-visit the current view at a later time.

  - For example, changing the ``Instruction Grouping`` dropdown option to "Layer" will re-color the timeline based on the associated framework layer name.
  - To speed up initial load times, the default will be a ``Minimal View`` which only shows the instructions executed and the model FLOPs utilization (MFU) over time.  Changing between the minimal and full views can also be done through the ``Reset to Full View`` or ``Reset to Minimal View`` buttons.

|neuron-profile-view-settings|

Additionally, there are various summary tabs that can be clicked to provide more information on the model/NEFFs.

- ``Layer Summary`` shows timing information, FLOPs and instructions counts per layer.
- ``Selection Summary`` shows summarized information for all data points in the selected window when using the "Box Select" mode.
- ``NEFF Header`` shows details on the profiled NEFF, such as the number of NeuronCores required to execute.
- ``NEFF Nodes`` shows input, output, and weight tensor information, including name, size, and shape.
- ``Model Info`` shows a summary of the NTFF, such as the NeuronCore the model was executed on, number of notifications, and hardware execution time.
- ``DMA Queues Info`` shows more information on the queues used for data movement.
- ``NC Memory Usage Info`` shows a snapshot of the device memory usage breakdown before profiling was started.
- ``Terminology`` shows a description of metrics provided in the summary table.

|neuron-profile-web-summaries|

Performance Warnings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Furthermore, ``neuron-profile`` will automatically highlight some potential performance issues with warning annotations. For example if a tensor has been loaded more than 2 times a warning annotation (seen below as an orange box) will be drawn, encircling the dma instructions where the tensor was loaded many times.
Hover on the annotation to see more details about loading the tensor. Another kind of warning annotation will highlight areas of high throttling. This provides the user a potential reason for slow down (thermal protection). Specific throttling details are shown when hovering the annotation.

|neuron-profile-tensor-reload-annotation|

.. _neuron-profile-collectives-barrier:

Collectives
~~~~~~~~~~~

For models involving collective operations, the timeline will show a box around all data points related to each operation.  Hovering the top left of the box will reveal more information associated with the operation.

.. note::
    this feature requires profiles to be captured with Neuron Runtime 2.20 or higher.

|neuron-profile-cc-op-annotation|

Additionally, for any on-device collectives synchronization barrier, a similar box will be display indicating a barrier instead of an actual collectives operation.

|neuron-profile-cc-op-barrier|

Event Details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The information when a point is clicked is grouped by categories such as `Timing` or `IDs` for convenience.
Each row will also include a tool tip on the right side, which can be hovered for an explanation on what the field represents.
For instruction `Operands` specifically, clicking on the tooltip will reveal a breakdown of fields that compose an operand, as well as a generic example for reference.  The examples may not apply directly to the currently viewed profile.

|neuron-profile-click-tooltip|


.. _neuron-profile-framework-stack-trace:

Framework Stack Trace
----------------------------

The Framework Stack Trace feature shows up in the Event Details when an instruction on the device profile is clicked. This can we used to map the device instructions back to framework level code in JAX or PyTorch to better understand what part of the application code resulted in a particular device instruction.

|neuron-profile-stack-trace-event-details|

To enable tracking of the stack trace information, you need to set environment variables before compiling your NEFF:

::

    export XLA_IR_DEBUG=1
    export XLA_HLO_DEBUG=1

Once you have the NEFF, you can simply capture the profile as usual. While viewing the profile use the ``--framework-source-root`` to pass the path to framework source files. This is optional and is only needed if you want to view your code along side the profile.

::

    $ neuron-profile view -n file.neff -s profile.ntff --framework-source-root /path/to/framework/source/files

|neuron-profile-stack-trace-viewer|

Searching Profiles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Searching helps identify specific data points that may be worth investigating, such as all instructions related to a specific layer or operation.
In the "Search" tab, select the corresponding field of interest and enter the value to search for.  Multiple fields can be searched together.  Please refer to the tooltip within the tab for more help on the query syntax.
The search results will also include a summary of all data points found within the current time range.

|neuron-profile-search-summary|


Hardware Errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Invalid code can lead to errors on Neuron hardware. These errors will be displayed in Neuron Profile's Custom Notification timeline, as shown below. For example an Out of Bounds (OOB) error is displayed as:

|neuron-profile-oob-error|

Users can correlate the error to the time it occurred and view nearby events to help debug.


.. _neuron-profile-scratchpad-mem-usage:

View Scratchpad Usage With Memory Tracker
------------------------------------------

The Memory Tracker feature in Neuron Profiler provides detailed insights into scratchpad memory usage over time, showing how memory is allocated and utilized by different tensors during model execution. This is particularly useful for understanding memory bottlenecks and optimizing memory usage patterns.

To enable Memory Tracker, you need to set environment variables before compiling your NEFF:

::

    export XLA_IR_DEBUG=1
    export XLA_HLO_DEBUG=1

Then compile your model with these debug flags enabled. After compilation, capture the profile with the ``--enable-dge-notifs`` flag or set ``NEURON_RT_ENABLE_DGE_NOTIFICATIONS=1``:

::

    $ neuron-profile capture -n file.neff --enable-dge-notifs

Finally, view the profile with Memory Tracker enabled:

::

    $ neuron-profile view -n file.neff -s profile.ntff --enable-memory-tracker

The Memory Tracker displays a timeline showing scratchpad memory usage over time, with a detailed breakdown of which tensors are consuming memory at any given point. This visualization helps identify:

- Peak scratchpad memory usage
- Memory allocation patterns
- Tensor-specific memory consumption
- Potential memory optimization opportunities

|neuron-profiler-memory-tracker|

You can interact with the Memory Tracker timeline similar to other profile views - clicking on memory usage bars will show detailed information about the tensors using memory at that time, and you can zoom in to specific time ranges to get a more detailed view of memory allocation patterns.


Viewing Profiles with Perfetto
------------------------------

Perfetto is an open-source trace analysis toolkit with a powerful UI for visualizing and analyzing trace data.
Users of Neuron Profiler have the option of viewing their profiles in the Perfetto UI.

To process your profile and generate a Perfetto trace file that can be viewed in the Perfetto UI run the following command:

::

    $ neuron-profile view -n file.neff -s profile.ntff --output-format perfetto

This will generate a ntff.pftrace file. Go to https://ui.perfetto.dev/ in your browser and open the ntff.pftrace file to view your profile in Perfetto.

.. note::
    When loading trace files in the Perfetto UI, your data is processed locally and not uploaded to Perfetto’s servers.


|neuron-profile-perfetto-device|

.. _neuron-profile-large-perfetto-profiles:

Viewing Large Profiles In Perfetto
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your browser may run out of memory when viewing ``ntff.pftrace`` (Perfetto trace) files that are more than a few hundred MB.
To get around this problem you can use the trace processor script by running the following command on your local system where you wish to view the profile

::

    curl -LO https://get.perfetto.dev/trace_processor
    chmod +x ./trace_processor
    ./trace_processor --httpd ntff.pftrace

Now go to  https://ui.perfetto.dev/ in your browser and in the dialog box that pops up click the  “YES, use loaded trace” button.

For more information on using the trace processor script and viewing large traces, please refer to the 
Perfetto documentation at https://perfetto.dev/docs/visualization/large-traces.

Showing Dependencies In Perfetto
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default Neuron Profiler does not process dependencies for profiles to be viewed in Perfetto because Perfetto renders 
the full dependency chain which can be visually overwhelming. To include dependencies that can be viewed when clicking 
instructions and DMAs in the Perfetto UI, use the ``--show-perfetto-flows`` flag when processing your profile.

::

    $ neuron-profile view -n file.neff -s profile.ntff --output-format perfetto --show-perfetto-flows


CLI reference
-------------

.. rubric:: neuron-profile capture

.. program:: neuron-profile

.. option:: neuron-profile capture [parameters] [inputs...]

    Takes a given compiled NEFF, executes it, and collects the profile results.
    When no inputs are provided, all-zero inputs are used, which may result in inf or NaNs.
    It is recommended to use ``--ignore-inference``

    - :option:`-n,--neff` (string): the compiled NEFF to profile

    - :option:`-s,--session-file` (string): the file to store profile session information in

    - :option:`--ignore-exec-errors`: ignore errors during execution

    - :option:`inputs` (positional args): list of inputs in the form of <NAME> <FILE_PATH> separated by space. Eg IN1 x.npy IN2 y.npy


    The following ``neuron-profile capture`` arguments are only relevant for multi-worker jobs

    - :option:`--collectives-profile-id` (string): worker id which will be profiled. Passing ``all`` profiles all workers. (default: ``all``)

    - :option:`-r,--collectives-workers-per-node` (int): the number of workers on the current node. The global worker id (rank) of worker n on current node is ``collectives-worker-start-id+n``

    - :option:`--collectives-worker-count` (int): total number of Neuron workers across all nodes for this collectives run.

    - :option:`--collectives-worker-start-id` (int): The rank offset for the first worker on the current node. For example, if node 0 has workers 0,1 and node 1 has workers 2,3 then ``collectives-worker-start-id`` for node 0 and 1 will be 0 and 2, respectively. (default: ``0``)

.. option:: neuron-profile view [parameters]

    - :option:`-n,--neff-path` (string): the compiled NEFF file location

    - :option:`-s,--session-file` (string): the profile results NTFF file location

    - :option:`-d,--session-dir` (string): directory containing profile files for multi-worker runs

    - :option:`--output-format` (string): how the processed profile should be presented. The default ``db`` write processed data to the database. ``summary-text`` and ``summary-json`` print the summary data as a table or json, respectively, without writing to the datebase. The ``perfetto`` option writes processed data to Perfetto's native protobuf based tracing format, and can be visualized in the Perfetto UI. The ``JSON`` option writes processed data to human-readable JSON. (default: ``db``)

    - :option:`--output-file` (string): file path to write results to, if applicable for the given output format

    - :option:`--terminology`: print a helpful table of terminology used by the profiler

    - :option:`--enable-memory-tracker`: Enable Memory Tracker to view scratchpad usage over time with a breakdown of usage per tensor. This requires having set ``XLA_IR_DEBUG=1`` and ``XLA_HLO_DEBUG=1`` before NEFF compilation and passing ``--enable-dge-notifs`` when capturing the profile.


Troubleshooting
---------------

InfluxDB not installed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    $ neuron-profile view -n file.neff -s profile.ntff
    ERRO[0001] To install influxdb, go to https://portal.influxdata.com/downloads/ and follow the instructions there
    influxdb not setup correctly: exec: "influx": executable file not found in $PATH

::

    $ neuron-profile view -n file.neff -s profile.ntff
    ERRO[0000]                                              
    influxdb token not setup correctly: exit status 1
    Try executing "systemctl start influxdb" and "influx setup"

Running ``neuron-profile view`` without InfluxDB installed will result in an error and a pointer to the InfluxDB installation instructions.
Please follow the provided instructions and retry.

Too many open files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    influxdb2client E! Write error: internal error: unexpected error writing points to database: [shard 10677] open /home/ubuntu/.influxdbv2/engine/data/7caae65aaa48380d/autogen/10677/index/0/MANIFEST: too many open files

InfluxDB will encounter "too many open files" and out of memory errors after a few hundred buckets have been created.
Two ways to solve this are to delete unused buckets or increase the system file descriptor limit.

To increase the file descriptor limit, add the following lines to ``/etc/security/limits.d/efa.conf`` and ``/etc/security/limits.conf``:

::

    *               soft    nofile      1048576
    *               hard    nofile      1048576

Add the following lines to /etc/sysctl.conf

::

    ssh -L 3001:localhost:3001 -L 8086:localhost:8086 remote_machine
