Overview
--------

``neuron-profile`` is a tool to profile and analyze performance of a ML model compiled with the Neuron compiler
and run on NeuronDevices.

.. note::

    Please use the ``aws-neuronx-tools`` package from Neuron SDK 2.11 or higher.

``neuron-profile`` helps developers identify performance bottlenecks and optimize their workloads for NeuronDevices. neuron-profile provides insights into NeuronDevice activity including the instructions executed on each compute engine (ex. Tensor engine, Vector engine, etc.), DMA data movement activity, and performance metrics such as engine utilization, DMA throughput, memory usage, and more. NeuronDevice activity is collected by the ``neuron-profile capture`` command which runs the model with tracing enabled. Profiling typically has near zero overhead because NeuronDevices have dedicated on-chip hardware profiling.

Additionally, ``neuron-profile`` supports Neuron Kernel Interface (NKI) developers in profiling their kernels. For more information, please refer to :ref:`neuron_profile_for_nki`

Installation
------------

``neuron-profile`` comes as part of the ``aws-neuronx-tools`` package, and will be installed to ``/opt/aws/neuron/bin``.

The Neuron web profile viewer utilizes InfluxDB OSS 2.x to store time series data for the profiled workloads after post processing.
Please follow the instructions provided at https://portal.influxdata.com/downloads/ for the correct OS.  A sample installation
of Neuron Profile and InfluxDB is provided below.

Capturing a profile
-------------------

The ``neuron-profile`` tool can both capture and post-process profiling information. ``neuron-profile`` takes a compiled model (a NEFF), executes it, and saves the profile results to a NTFF (``profile.ntff`` by default).
For this example, we assume a NEFF is already available as ``file.neff``

::

    $ neuron-profile capture -n file.neff -s profile.ntff

Capturing profiles for multi-worker jobs
----------------------------------------

``neuron-profile`` can capture profiles for collectives-enabled NEFFs running across multiple NeuronCores, NeuronDevices, or even nodes. 
This is useful for understanding performance and communication overheads when deploying larger distributed models.

The following example, performs a distributed run across all NeuronDevices and NeuronCores on an inf2.24xlarge instances, capturing profiles for all 12 workers (one for each NeuronCore).

::

    $ neuron-profile capture -n file.neff --collectives-workers-per-node 12 -s output/profile.ntff

A profile is saved for each worker in the output directory.

:: 

    $ ls output
    profile_rank_0.ntff   profile_rank_2.ntff  profile_rank_6.ntff profile_rank_1.ntff   profile_rank_3.ntff  profile_rank_7.ntff
    profile_rank_10.ntff  profile_rank_4.ntff  profile_rank_8.ntff profile_rank_11.ntff  profile_rank_5.ntff  profile_rank_9.ntff

It is also possible to run a distributed job while only capturing a profile for a specific worker instead of all workers. To do that, use the ``--collectives-profile-id`` option.

::

    $ neuron-profile capture -n file.neff --collectives-profile-id 5 --collectives-workers-per-node 12 -s output/profile.ntff
    $ ls output
    profile_rank_5.ntff


Capturing profiles for multi-node jobs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For multi-node jobs, ``neuron-profile`` must be invoked on each node using the ``collectives-worker-start-id`` to specify the global index of the first worker on the given
node. For example, for a two node job with a total of four workers and two workers per node, the following commands are run on each node.

::

    # on node 0
    $ neuron-profile capture -n file.neff --collectives-worker-start-id 0 --collectives-workers-per-node 2 --collectives-worker-count 4
    # on node 1
    $ neuron-profile capture -n file.neff --collectives-worker-start-id 2 --collectives-workers-per-node 2 --collectives-worker-count 4

``neuron-profile`` saves the profile for a worker on the node where that worker was launched. So in the case above, ``profile_rank_0.ntff`` and ``profile_rank_1.ntff``
are saved to node 0, and ``profile_rank_2.ntff`` and ``profile_rank_3.ntff`` are saved to node 1.



Processing and viewing the profile results
------------------------------------------

The ``view`` subcommand of ``neuron-profile`` will handle post-processing the profiling data and starting up an HTTP server that users can
navigate to in order to see profiling results.

Viewing a single profile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first way to invoke ``neuron-profile view`` is to pass both the NEFF and the NTFF to this command.
It will post-process these artifacts and print out a direct link to the profile view.

::

    $ neuron-profile view -n file.neff -s profile.ntff
    View profile at http://localhost:3001/profile/n_fdc71a0b582ee3009711a96e59958af921243921
    ctrl-c to exit


Viewing profiles for multi-worker jobs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Profiles from multi-worker jobs (i.e. more than one NeuronCore) can either be viewed individually or in a combined collectives view.
Since profile data is often similar between workers and processing profile data for all workers can be time-consuming, it is recommended to first 
explore the profile for a single worker or small subset of workers. Viewing the profile for a specific worker is the same as for single-worker profiles.

::

    $ neuron-profile view -n file.neff -s output/profile_rank_5.ntff
    View profile at http://localhost:3001/profile/n_fdc71a0b582ee3009711a96e59958af921243921


To view the profile for multiple workers, pass the directory containing all worker profiles to ``neuron-profile``.

::

    $ neuron-profile view -n file.neff -d output
    View profile at http://localhost:3001/profile_cc/p_9a69d907e1350100c9b03745eaa67aa7422842ed

|neuron-profile-multiworker-timeline|

When viewing profiles with the combined collectives view you can easily switch between the timelines of different workers by clicking
the "Rank <x>" tabs.

Note: the "CC Aggregated View" currently shows no data. This will be populated in an upcoming release. 


Viewing multiple profiles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alternatively, when post-processing multiple profiles, it may be desirable to have a persistent server running while processing results in the background.
In this case, we can skip passing arguments to the command, which will direct users to the main page listing all available profiles.

::

    $ neuron-profile view
    View a list of profiles at http://localhost:3001/

In a separate window, we can kick off the post-processing without launching another server by passing the ``--ingest-only`` flag.

::

    $ neuron-profile view -n file.neff -s profile.ntff --ingest-only
    Profile "n_47cf9972d42798d236caa68952d0d29a76d8bd66" is ready to view

``n_47cf9972d42798d236caa68952d0d29a76d8bd66`` is the bucket where the data is stored.  We can find this profile at ``localhost:3001/profile/<bucket>``.

Accessing the profiles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If ``neuron-profile view`` is run on a remote instance, you may need to use port forwarding to access the profiles.

From the local machine, SSH to the remote instance and forward ports 3001 (the default ``neuron-profile`` HTTP server port) and 8086 (the default
InfluxDB port).  Then in the browser, go to ``localhost:3001`` to view the profiles.

::

    $ ssh <user>@<ip> -L 3001:localhost:3001 -L 8086:localhost:8086


.. _neuron-profile-ug-alternative-outputs:

Alternative output formats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Besides the web view mentioned above, ``neuron-profile`` also supports other output formats such as ``summary-text`` and ``summary-json`` for viewing overall metrics of the profile,
as well as ``json`` for a parsable alternative.

Profile summary
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can see a summary of each profile using the command ``neuron-profile view --output-format summary-text -n file.neff -s output/profile_rank_<i>.ntff``. This output
includes summary metrics and fields for the NeuronCore (``nc_idx``) and NeuronDevice (``nd_idx``) on which the worker was run. For example, the following shows worker 5 used core 1 on
device 3 and took 0.017 seconds (17 ms) to run the model.

::

    $ neuron-profile view --output-format summary-text -n file.neff -s output/profile_rank_5.ntff | grep -e "nd_idx" -e "nc_idx" -e "total_time"
    nc_idx      1
    nd_idx      2
    total_time  0.017

This summary is also available as JSON using ``--output-format summary-json``.

JSON
^^^^

You can also view the profile summary and all post-processed profiler events together as a single JSON. To do that, use the ``--output-format json`` option.

::

    $ neuron-profile view --output-format json --output-file profile.json -n file.neff -s output/profile_rank_5.ntff
    $ cat profile.json
    {
        "summary": [
            {
                "total_time": 0.017,
                "event_count": 11215
                [...]
            }
        ],
        "instruction": [
            {
                "timestamp": 10261883214,
                "duration": 148,
                "label": "TensorMatrix",
                "hlo_name": "%add.1 = add(%dot, %custom-call.44)",
                "opcode": "MATMUL",
                "operands": "S[5] (Tensor)++@complete acc_flags=3 row_grp=q0 src=fp16@0x5600[1,0,0][3,1,1] dst=0x2000000[1,0,0][3,1,1] 3*128 "
            },
            [...]
        ]
    }

Understanding a Neuron profile
------------------------------

The section provides a quick overview on what features and information are available through the Neuron web profile viewer.

For more information on terms used, please check out the :ref:`neuron_hw_glossary`.

Timeline
~~~~~~~~

|neuron-profile-web-timeline|

The execution timeline is plotted based on the elapsed nanoseconds since the start of execution.

Starting from the bottom, the ``TensorMatrix Utilization`` shows the efficiency of the TensorEngine, and
the ``Pending DMA Count`` and ``DMA Throughput`` rows show the DMA activity.  In general, we want these to be as high
as possible, and in some cases may help give clues as to whether the workload is memory or compute bound.

Next are the individual NeuronCore engine executions.  These rows show the start and end times for instructions executed by each
engine, and clicking on one of these bars will show more detailed information, as well as any dependencies that were found.
For models involving collective compute operations, you will additionally see rows labeled with ``CC-core``, which are used to synchronize
the CC operations.

Towards the top is the DMA activity.  These can include the transfers of input and output tensors, intermediate tensors, and any
additional spilling or loading to and from the on-chip SRAM memory.


.. _neuron-profile-ug-features:

Features
~~~~~~~~

The following are some useful features that may help with navigating a profile:

- Dragging your cursor across a portion of the timeline will zoom in to the selected window, providing a more in depth view of the execution during that time period.
- Hovering over a point will reveal a subset of information associated with it.
- Clicking a point will open a text box below the timeline with all the information associated with it.
- Right-clicking a point will drop a marker at a certain location.  This marker will persist when zooming in and out.

  - All marker information can be found by clicking the ``Annotations`` button.
  - Markers can be saved and loaded by using a provided name for the marker set.
  - Individual markers can be renamed or deleted in this menu as well.

- The "Search" tab can be used to find and highlight specific points in the profile related to the queried field(s).
- Click on the "Box Select" button in the top-right corner of the timeline and then click and drag on any region of the plot to select all events in that region and get summary statistics such as total duration and breakdowns of opcodes, transfer_sizes, and more.
- The ``Edit view settings`` can be used to further customize the timeline view.  For example, changing the ``Instruction Grouping`` dropdown option to "Layer" will re-color the timeline based on the associated framework layer name.  Editing any settings will update the URL accordingly, which can be used to re-visit the current view at a later time.

Additionally, there are various summary buttons that can be clicked to provide more information on the model/NEFF, such as the input and output tensors,
number of FLOPs, and the start and end of a framework layer.

|neuron-profile-web-summaries|

Furthermore, ``neuron-profile`` will automatically highlight some potential performance issues with warning annotations. For example if tensor has been loaded more than 2 times a warning annotation (seen below as an orange box) will be drawn on encircling the dma instructions where the tensor was loaded many times. Hover on annotation to see more details about loading the tensor. Another kind of warning annotation will highlight areas of high throttling. This provides the user a potential reason for slow down (thermal protection) and specific throttling details are shown when hovering the annotation.

|neuron-profile-tensor-reload-annotation|

For models involving collective operations, the timeline will show a box around all data points related to each operation.  Hovering the top left of the box will reveal more information associated with the operation.
Note: this feature requires profiles to be captured with Neuron Runtime 2.20 or higher.

|neuron-profile-cc-op-annotation|

The information when a point is clicked is grouped by categories such as `Timing` or `IDs` for convenience.
Each row will also include a tool tip on the right side, which can be hovered for an explanation on what the field represents.
For instruction `Operands` specifically, clicking on the tooltip will reveal a breakdown of fields that compose an operand, as well as a generic example for reference.  The examples may not apply directly to the currently viewed profile.

|neuron-profile-click-tooltip|

Searching helps identify specific data points that may be worth investigating, such as all instructions related to a specific layer or operation.
In the "Search" tab, select the corresponding field of interest and enter the value to search for.  Multiple fields can be searched together.  Please refer to the tooltip within the tab for more help on the query syntax.
The search results will also include a summary of all data points found within the current time range.

|neuron-profile-search-summary|

Troubleshooting
---------------

InfluxDB not installed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    $ neuron-profile view -n file.neff -s profile.ntff
    ERRO[0001] To install influxdb, go to https://portal.influxdata.com/downloads/ and follow the instructions there
    influxdb not setup correctly: exec: "influx": executable file not found in $PATH

::

    $ neuron-profile view -n file.neff -s profile.ntff
    ERRO[0000]                                              
    influxdb token not setup correctly: exit status 1
    Try executing "systemctl start influxdb" and "influx setup"

Running ``neuron-profile view`` without InfluxDB installed will result in an error and a pointer to the InfluxDB installation instructions.
Please follow the provided instructions and retry.

Too many open files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    influxdb2client E! Write error: internal error: unexpected error writing points to database: [shard 10677] open /home/ubuntu/.influxdbv2/engine/data/7caae65aaa48380d/autogen/10677/index/0/MANIFEST: too many open files

InfluxDB will encounter "too many open files" and out of memory errors after a few hundred buckets have been created.
Two ways to solve this are to delete unused buckets or increase the system file descriptor limit.

To increase the file descriptor limit, add the following lines to ``/etc/security/limits.d/efa.conf`` and ``/etc/security/limits.conf``:

::

    *               soft    nofile      1048576
    *               hard    nofile      1048576

Add the following lines to /etc/sysctl.conf

::

    fs.file-max = 197341270
    vm.max_map_count=1048576

Commit changes by running ``sudo sysctl -p``.

When viewing UI "FATAL - Failed metadata query"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are SSH port forwarding the web UI from a remote machine to your local desktop you will need to port forward both the web UI (3001) and the database (8086) like so:

::

    ssh -L 3001:localhost:3001 -L 8086:localhost:8086 remote_machine
