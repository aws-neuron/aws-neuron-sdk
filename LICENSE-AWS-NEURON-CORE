You will not remove, modify, or obscure any copyright, patent, trademark or other proprietary or attribution notices on or in any Software.

3. Hazardous or Critical Uses

If you provide Feedback to AWS, AWS may use and exercise any and all rights in the Feedback without obligation or restriction of any kind during and after the term of this Agreement, and Feedback will not be deemed to be confidential information or otherwise create any confidentiality obligation. You will not provide any Feedback that: (a) you know is subject to any patent, copyright, or other intellectual property claim or right of any third party; or (b) is subject to license terms which seek to require any products incorporating or derived from the Feedback, or other AWS intellectual property, to be licensed to or otherwise shared with any third party.

You do not acquire any intellectual property or other rights in the Software as a result of downloading, installing, using or distributing the Software.

6. Updates
In order to keep the Software up-to-date, we may offer automatic or manual updates or upgrades at any time and you will ensure that Software will be updated in a reasonable amount of time. The terms of this Agreement govern any updates or upgrades to the Software that we may provide that replace or supplement the original Software, unless the update or upgrade is accompanied by a separate license, in which case the terms of that license will govern such update or upgrade. All copies of the Software (a) that are in your possession or control or (b) for which you have automatic update rights must utilize the current Software version (“Current Updates”).

14. Supplemental Terms and Conditions
a. If you are subject to an AWS Customer Agreement or AWS Enterprise Agreement, in the event of any conflict or inconsistency among the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the existing AWS Customer Agreement or AWS Enterprise Agreement, such conflict or inconsistency will be resolved by giving precedence to this Agreement.
b. If you are not subject to an AWS Customer Agreement or AWS Enterprise Agreement, the following additional terms and conditions apply:
	i. Assignment. You will not assign or otherwise transfer this Agreement or any of your rights
	and obligations under this Agreement, without our prior written consent. Any assignment or transfer in violation of this Section 14(b)(i) will be void. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns.
	ii. Governing Law. The laws of the State of Washington, without reference to conflict of law rules, govern this Agreement and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and us. The United Nations Convention for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to this Agreement.
	iii. Disputes. Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of the Software, or to any products or services sold or distributed by AWS, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this Agreement. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of this Agreement as a court would. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration 
	and describing your claim to our registered agent Corporation Service Company, 300 Deschutes Way SW, Suite 304, Tumwater, WA 98501. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, which are available at w		ww.adr.org or by calling 1800-778-7879. Payment of filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. We will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or at a mutually agreed location. We and 
	you agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we and you waive any right to a jury trial. Subject to Section 2, we and you both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights. You will ensure that end-user terms included within the Equipment, in a clear and conspicu	ous way, will include mandatory arbitration requirement as the dispute resolution process for any and all claims arising out of the use of Equipment. Such end-user terms will also include, in a clear and conspicuous way, (i) a waiver for any right to a jury trial, and (ii) a waiver for class action proceedings.
	iv. Independent Contractors; Non-Exclusive Rights. We and you are independent contractors, and this Agreement will not be construed to create a partnership, joint venture, agency, or employment relationship. Neither party, nor any of their respective affiliates, is an agent of the other for any purpose or has the authority to bind the other. Both parties reserve the right (a) to develop or have developed for it products, services, concepts, systems, or techniques that are similar to or compete with the products, services, concepts, systems, or techniques developed or contemplated by the other party, and (b) to assist third party developers or systems integrators who may offer products or services which compete with the other party’s products or services.
	v. Language. All communications and notices made or given pursuant to this Agreement must be in the English language. If we provide a translation of the English language version of this Agreement, the English language version of the Agreement will control if there is any conflict.
	vi. Confidentiality and Publicity. You may use AWS confidential information only in connection with your use of the Software as permitted under this Agreement. You will not disclose AWS confidential information during the term or at any time during the 5-year period following the end of the term. You will take all reasonable measures to avoid disclosure, dissemination or unauthorized use of AWS Confidential Information, including, at a minimum, those measures you take to protect your own confidential information of a similar nature.
	vii. No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except as set forth in Section 9, this Agreement does not create any third-party beneficiary rights in any individual or entity that is not a party to this Agreement.

15. Entire Agreement and Severability
This is the entire agreement between AWS and you regarding the Software and supersedes all prior understandings regarding such subject matter (including any Evaluation Agreement). If any term or condition of this Agreement is deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that part will be deemed severable and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining term or condition.
