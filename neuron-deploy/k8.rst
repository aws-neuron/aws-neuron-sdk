===============================
Introduction
------------
Use of Neuron in containers on a Kubernetes cluster can be simple to achieve by following :ref:`tutorial-k8s-env-setup-for-neuron`

Known Limitations
-----------------
Scheduling on k8s cluster requires contiguous neuron device-ids.  Neuron provides a scheduler extension to solve this problem for self-managed k8 clusters.  Read more about it here: :ref:`neuron-k8-scheduler-ext`.
