AWS Neuron feature roadmap

Introduction
------------

The AWS Neuron feature roadmap provides visibility onto what we are
working on in terms of functional and performance in the near future. We
hope this will help you better plan how to use Neuron with your
products. We’d love to get our customers feedback as well, to help us
ensure we are working on the most important requests.

FAQs
----

Q: Why did you build this?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A: We know that our customers are making decisions and plans based on
what we are developing, and we want to provide them with the right
visibility to what we are working on, as well as the opportunity to
provide direct feedback.

Q: What do the roadmap categories mean?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Completed - feature complete and supported by Neuron.
-  Coming soon - feature is nearing completion, likely being planned for
   an upcoming release. Think a 2-3 weeks out, give or take.
-  We're working on it - in progress, but further out. We might still be
   working through the implementation details, or scoping stuff out.
   This is a great phase to give us feedback as to how you want to see
   something implemented. We’ll benefit from your specific use cases
   here.

Q: Why are there no dates on your roadmap?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A: We are not providing exact target dates for releases because we
prioritize operational excellence, security and quality over hitting a
specific date. If you have an urgent need for a feature, please contact
us directly at aws-neuron-support@amazon.com.

Q: Is everything on the roadmap?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A: We are focusing on upgrades for existing features, as well as
building new features. We will keep adding features and capabilities to
this roadmap as time progresses.

Q: How can I provide feedback or ask for more information?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A: When in doubt, please create an issue or post a question on the `AWS
Neuron support
forum <https://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=355>`__.

Q: How can I request a feature be added to the roadmap?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A: We encourage you to open an issue. All community-submitted issues
will be reviewed by the roadmap maintainers.

Q: Can I "+1" existing issues?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A:We strongly encourage you to do so, as it helps us understand which
issues will have the widest impact. You can navigate to the issue
details page and add a reaction (thumbs up). There are six types of
reactions supported (thumbs down “-1”, confused, heart, watching, laugh,
hooray, and thumbs up +1).
