==================

Date 5/11/2020

.. _summary-4:

Summary
-------

Fix potential installation issue when installing both tensorboard and
tensorboard-neuron.

.. _resolved-issues-1:

Resolved Issues
---------------

-  Added tensorboard as a dependency in tensorboard-neuron. This
   prevents the issue of overwriting tensorboard-neuron features when
   tensorboard is installed after tensorboard-neuron.

Summary
-------

Added ability to view CPU node latency in the Graphs plugin and the
Neuron Profile plugins.

Major New Features
------------------

-  Added an aggregate view in addition to the current Neuron subgraph
   view for both the Graphs plugin and the Neuron Profile plugin.
-  When visualizing a graph executed on a Neuron device, CPU node
   latencies are available when coloring the graph by "Compute time"
   using the "neuron_profile" tag.
-  The Neuron Profile plugin now has an overview page to compare time
   spent on Neuron device versus on CPU.

.. _other-notes-1:

Other Notes
-----------

-  Requires Neuron-RTD config option "enable_node_profiling" to be set
   to "true"

.. _resolved-issues-4:

Resolved Issues
---------------

N/A - first release

.. _known-issues--limits-1:

Known Issues & Limits
---------------------

-  Must install TensorBoard-Neuron by itself, or after regular
   TensorBoard is installed. If regular Tensorboard is installed after
   TensorBoard-Neuron, it may overwrite some needed files.
-  Utilization missing in Op Profile due to missing FLOPs calculation
   (see overview page instead)
-  Neuron Profile plugin may not immediately show up on launch (try
   reloading the page)
-  Graphs with NeuronOps may take a long time to load due to attribute
   size
-  Instructions that cannot be matched to a framework layer/operator
   name show as “” (blank)
-  CPU Usage section in chrome-trace is not applicable
-  Debugger currently supports TensorFlow only
-  Visualization requires a TensorFlow-compatible graph
