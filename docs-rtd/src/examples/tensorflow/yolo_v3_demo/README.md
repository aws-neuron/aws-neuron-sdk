## Working with YOLO v3 using AWS Neuron SDK
The [`evaluate.ipynb`](https://github.com/aws/aws-neuron-sdk/blob/master/src/examples/tensorflow/yolo_v3_demo/evaluate.ipynb) notebook contains an example on how to take an open source YOLO v3 models, and run it on AWS Inferentia.

Also please take a look at https://github.com/aws/aws-neuron-sdk/blob/master/src/examples/tensorflow/yolo_v4_demo/README.md for our YOLO v4 support as well as some performance optimization tips for deploying object detection models on Inferentia.
