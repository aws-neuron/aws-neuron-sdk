============

Neuron includes a set of tools and capabilities to help developers monitor and optimize their Neuron based inference applications. Neuron tools can be incorporated into scripts to automate Neuron devices operation and health monitoring, and include discover and usage utilities, data-path profiling tools, and visualization utilities. Using a TensorBoard plugin you can inspect and profile graphs execution.
