Neuron Check Model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Overview
========

Neuron Check Model tool provides user with basic information about the compiled and uncompiled model's operations
without the use of TensorBoard-Neuron. For additional visibility into the models, please see :ref:`neuron-plugin-tensorboard`.

Neuron Check Model tool scans the user's uncompiled model and provides a table of the operations within the uncompiled
model. By default, the table shows each operation type and number of instances of that type within model, and whether
the type is supported in Neuron. If --show_names option is specified, the table shows each operation by name and
whether the type of that operation is supported in Neuron.

If the model is already compiled, the tool also provides the table of operations as for uncompiled model. The table
include the Neuron subgraph type and number of instances of that type, along with operations that have not been
compiled to Neuron. Additionally, the tool displays a message showing the minimum number of NeuronCores required to run the
model, followed by another table which shows the list of Neuron subgraphs by name and the number of pipelined
NeuronCores used by each subgraph. More information about NeuronCore pipeline can be found in
:ref:`neuroncore-pipeline`. If --expand_subgraph option is specified, the operations within each subgraph are
printed below the subgraph information.

Neuron Check Model tool is currently available for TensorFlow and MXNet. To check PT model, please use
torch.neuron.analyze_model function as shown in PyTorch-Neuron Getting Started tutorial :ref:`/src/examples/pytorch/resnet50.ipynb`

TensorFlow-Neuron Check Model
=============================

The following example shows how to run TensorFlow-Neuron Check Model tool with TensorFlow ResNet50 tutorial.

1. Start with the TensorFlow ResNet50 tutorial at :ref:`/src/examples/tensorflow/tensorflow_resnet50/resnet50.ipynb and do the first three steps of the
tutorial. Please stay in the Python environment that you setup during the tutorial.

2. Install needed tensorflow_hub package and download the tool:

::

    pip install tensorflow_hub
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-neuron-sdk/master/src/neuron-gatherinfo/tf_neuron_check_model.py
    python tf_neuron_check_model.py -h

::

    usage: tf_neuron_check_model.py [-h] [--show_names] [--expand_subgraph]
                                    model_path

    positional arguments:
      model_path         a TensorFlow SavedModel directory (currently supporting
                         TensorFlow v1 SaveModel only).

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help         show this help message and exit
      --show_names       list operation by name instead of summarizing by type
                         (caution: this option will generate many lines of output
                         for a large model).
      --expand_subgraph  show subgraph operations.

3. After step 3 of the TensorFlow ResNet50 tutorial, you can check the uncompiled model to see Neuron supported operations (currently supporting TensorFlow v1 SaveModel only):

::

    $ python tf_neuron_check_model.py ws_resnet50/resnet50/

    * The following table shows the supported and unsupported operations within this uncompiled model.
    * Each line shows an operation type, the number of instances of that type within model,
    * and whether the type is supported in Neuron.
    * Some operation types are excluded from table because they are no-operations or training-related operations:
     ['Placeholder', 'PlaceholderWithDefault', 'NoOp', 'Const', 'Identity', 'IdentityN', 'VarHandleOp',
     'VarIsInitializedOp', 'AssignVariableOp', 'ReadVariableOp', 'StringJoin', 'ShardedFilename', 'SaveV2',
     'MergeV2Checkpoints', 'RestoreV2']

    * Total inference operations: 504
    * Total Neuron supported inference operations: 504
    * Percent of total inference operations supported by Neuron: 100.0

4. You can also check the compiled model to see the number of pipeline NeuronCores for each subgraph:

::

    $ python tf_neuron_check_model.py ws_resnet50/resnet50_neuron/

    * Found 1 Neuron subgraph(s) (NeuronOp(s)) in this compiled model.
    * Use this tool on the original uncompiled model to see Neuron supported operations.

    * Each line shows an operation type, the number of instances of that type within model,
    * and whether the type is supported in Neuron.
    * Some operation types are excluded from table because they are no-operations or training-related operations:
