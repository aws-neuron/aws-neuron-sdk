| 1    | NERR_FAIL                    | Non specific failure, e.g.   |
|      |                              | low level interface to the   |
|      |                              | hardware error.              |

|      |                              | the request, e.g. for a      |
|      |                              | Neural Network that has not  |

|      |                              | Neural Network, not enough   |

|      |                              | Common causes: bad hugepages |
|      |                              | configuration (insufficient  |
|      |                              | number of reserved pages on  |
|      |                              | the system), failure to      |
|      |                              | initialize Neuron device.    |

|      |                              | inference input queue. The   |

|      |                              | completed inference requests |
|      |                              | is greater that whatâ€™s been  |
|      |                              | configured during NN load.   |
|      |                              | This is a transient error,   |
|      |                              | inference requests can be    |
|      |                              | submitted after some of the  |
|      |                              | in-flight inferences have    |
|      |                              | completed.                   |

+------+------------------------------+------------------------------+
| 10   | NERR_UNSUPPORTED_VERSION     | NN load failed because the   |
|      |                              | version of NEFF is not       |
|      |                              | supported.                   |

|      |                              | submitted to infer, e.g.     |
|      |                              | missing some of the input    |
|      |                              | tensors, incorrect input     |
|      |                              | tensor sizes.                |
+------+------------------------------+------------------------------+
| 1003 | NERR_                        | Inference is completed.      |
|      | INFER_COMPLETED_WITH_NUM_ERR | Numerical errors were        |
|      |                              | encountered while executing  |
|      |                              | the inference (NaN).         |
+------+------------------------------+------------------------------+
| 1004 | N                            | Inference is completed.      |
|      | ERR_INFER_COMPLETED_WITH_ERR | Non-numerical errors were    |
|      |                              | encoutered while executing   |
|      |                              | the inference. Usually       |
|      |                              | indicates problems with      |
|      |                              | compiled NN (compiler        |
|      |                              | errors) or the hardware      |
|      |                              | issues.                      |
