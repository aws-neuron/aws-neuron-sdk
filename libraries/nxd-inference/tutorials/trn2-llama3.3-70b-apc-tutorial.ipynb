    "## Background, Concepts, and Optimizations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Block KV Cache Layout\n",
    "\n",
    "To support prefix caching, NxDI now uses block kv cache layout. Enable block layout of\n",
    "the cache by setting `is_block_kv_layout=True` in NeuronConfig. The first two\n",
    "dimensions of the KV cache are set to the number of blocks and block size, respectively.\n",
    "These configurations are specified using `pa_num_blocks` and `pa_block_size` in NeuronConfig.\n",
    "\n",
    "For optimal performance with Neuron, it's recommended to set `pa_block_size=32`.\n",
    "The minimum required `pa_num_blocks` can be calculated using the formula\n",
    "`(batch_size * max_seq_len) / block_size` where batch_size is the compiled batch size\n",
    "and max_seq_len is the maximum sequence length of the compiled model on Neuron.\n",
    "While using the minimum block calculation will produce accurate results, it's recommended\n",
    "to initialize as many blocks as possible without exceeding HBM space limitations. This\n",
    "ensures that Neuron has sufficient blocks to save as much prefix data as possible. More cache\n",
    "blocks implies higher prefix caching hit rate and hence better context encoding performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Kernels\n",
    "\n",
    "NxD Inference supports kernels that optimize parts of the modeling code\n",
    "for best performance when prefix caching is enabled.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Token generation attention kernel with block kv cache read and update capabilities.\n",
    "  This kernel reads the cache blocks using the active block table, converts the required\n",
    "  blocks into flat layout, performs attention and scatters back the computed key and value\n",
    "  to the correct slot in the block cache layout. To enable this kernel, set\n",
    "  `attn_block_tkg_nki_kernel_enabled=True` and `attn_block_tkg_nki_kernel_cache_update=True`\n",
    "  in NeuronConfig."
