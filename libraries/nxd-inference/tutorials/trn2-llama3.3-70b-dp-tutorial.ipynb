    "## Data Parallel Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "We can achieve Data Parallelism by using multiple copies of the same model hosted on the instance to process multiple requests simultaneously. Using NxD Inference and vLLM, you can deploy multiple model endpoints by adjusting the tensor parallel degree (Tensor Parallelism (TP) refers to sharding model weight matrices onto multiple NeuronCores within each model copy) and allocating appropriate NeuronCore ranges for each model endpoint. While increasing the batch size with a single copy of the model increases throughput, introducing data parallelism with multiple model endpoints combined with tensor parallelism allows further increase in instance throughput with some impact to latency. Use this technique when you can relax the latency constraint of your application to further maximize the throughput of the instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we use Llama 3.3 70B with DP=2 and TP=32. However, you can follow the same sequence of steps to deploy additional model copies by appropriately changing the tensor parallel degree. You can also use this guide to deploy multiple copies of any other models on Trn1 or Inf2 instances as long as the model fits and the DP x TP degree does not exceed the number of model cores."

    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how data parallelism using multiple model copies can help increase the throughput. While standard batching (DP=1, BS>1) processes multiple requests through a single model copy, data parallelism deploys multiple independent model copies that can process different requests simultaneously. Our experiments with batch sizes 1 & 4 show that as we decrease Tensor Parallelism (TP) from 64 to 16 and increase Data Parallelism (DP) from 1 to 4, we see up to 2x throughput improvement with non optimized configurations. However, this comes with an increase in Time To First Token (TTFT) latency. This illustrates a key consideration: while DP can improve overall system throughput by processing more concurrent requests, it can lead to higher latency\n",

    "When to choose Data parallel with multiple model copies over using single model copy in an instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use DP when your workload is collective-bound rather than memory or compute-bound. At high batch sizes, TP64 / TP128 collectives can become slow due to the number of hops and increasing throughput requirements. At high enough batch size, it can be better to pay the cost of duplicated weight loads and use DP with multiple model copies in order to reduce collective latencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Consider DP when you need to handle many concurrent requests and can tolerate moderate latency increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation requires careful consideration of your total memory budget, as each additional model copy increases memory consumption. You'll need to balance the number of model copies against the resources allocated to each model copy based on your specific throughput and latency requirements. By understanding these trade-offs and following the implementation guidelines in this tutorial, users can select the most appropriate approach for their specific use case and optimize their inference setup accordingly."
