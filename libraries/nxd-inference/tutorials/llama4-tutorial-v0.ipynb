There is no need to download a Llama4 checkpoint from HuggingFace explicitly, but you may need access from Meta to download it as part of compilation script.

Additionally, there is one chunk to describe the entire image, resulting in the total number of chunks. Due to the use of data parallelism (DP) together with tensor parallelism (TP), the vision model input batch size is padded to the next value divisible by the DP degree, which in this case is 4. The final padded batch size will be:\n",
