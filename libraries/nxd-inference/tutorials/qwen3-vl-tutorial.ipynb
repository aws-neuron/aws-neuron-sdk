    "#### Model Compilation and Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "Certain configurations are used to optimize the performance of the model during compilation. These configurations are described below and can be modified for your specific use case.\n",
    "- Qwen3 VL consists of a text model and a vision encoder. You must specify configurations explicitly through `text_neuron_config` and `vision_neuron_config`.\n",
    "- `world_size`: max number of neuron cores in the distributed environment. Text and vision model must have the same world size.\n",
    "- `tp_degree`: degree of tensor parallelism. Text and vision model can use different sharding scheme and therefore different TP degree.\n",
    "- `batch_size`: This is set to the batch size for compiling the models. For optimized latency, Prefill is always done with batch_size = 1; hence `ctx_batch_size` in `text_neuron_config` and the `batch_size` in `vision_neuron_config` are set to 1. The `batch_size` and `tkg_batch_size` in `text_neuron_config` are set to the desired value for handling concurrent requests (same as max-num-seqs for the vllm argument). Currently, there is a known issue with batch size > 1 and this limitation will be addressed in future release.\n",
    "- `text_neuron_config`\n",
    "    - `seq_len`: Set this to the maximum sequence length in your use case. We currently support up to 32768 in the text model. This refers to the total length of vision and text, input and output tokens.\n",
    "    - `enable_bucketing`: [Bucketing](https://awsdocs-neuron.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/libraries/nxd-inference/developer_guides/feature-guide.html#bucketing) allows one to optimize performance for specific sequence lengths and in this case we [configure specific buckets](https://awsdocs-neuron.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/libraries/nxd-inference/developer_guides/feature-guide.html#configuring-specific-buckets).\n",
    "    - `context_encoding_buckets`: This refers to the prefill/context encoding phase and should be set to handle different total length of vision and text input tokens.\n",
    "    - Note that in Qwen3 VL, vision embeddings are spatially compressed by a factor of `spatial_merge_size ** 2` before being fed into the text model. This value is defined in the model's `config.json`. As a result, the effective text context length is calculated as: `text_context_len = vision_seq_len // (spatial_merge_size ** 2)`.\n",
    "    - `token_generation_buckets`: This refers to the decode/token generation phase. The bucket size should reflect the total sequence length, which is the sum of vision tokens, text input tokens, and output tokens.\n",
    "    - `fused_qkv`: [QKV weight fusion](https://awsdocs-neuron.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/libraries/nxd-inference/developer_guides/feature-guide.html#qkv-weight-fusion) concatenates a model’s query, key and value weight matrices to achieve better performance.\n",
    "    - `qkv_kernel_enabled`: Enable the use of the fused QKV kernel.\n",
    "    - `mlp_kernel_enabled`: Enable the use of the MLP kernel.\n",
    "    - `attn_kernel_enabled`: Enable the use of the Flash Attention kernel.\n",
    "- `vision_neuron_config`\n",
    "    - `seq_len`: Set this to the maximum vision sequence length in your use case. We currently support up to 16384 in the vision model. Vision sequence length is calculated by `num_images * (image_height//patch_size) * (image_width//patch_size)`.\n",
    "    - `buckets`: Set this to handle different vision sequence lengths.\n",
    "    - `fused_qkv`: [QKV weight fusion](https://awsdocs-neuron.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/libraries/nxd-inference/developer_guides/feature-guide.html#qkv-weight-fusion) concatenates a model’s query, key and value weight matrices to achieve better performance.\n"

The cat has thick, fluffy fur that's a mix of brown, gray, and maybe some lighter shades. Its fur is dusted with snow, so it's in a winter setting. The cat is walking on snow, with one paw lifted, so it's in motion. The background has white birch trees with black bark patterns, typical of a snowy forest.

The snow on the ground is fresh, and there are some small twigs or debris visible. The cat's face has distinctive markings, like the white area around the mouth and the striped pattern on its cheeks.
