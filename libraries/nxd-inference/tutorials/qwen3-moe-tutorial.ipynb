Maybe they want to check if I can remember their name or if I can be friendly. I need to acknowledge their name properly and invite them to ask questions. Also, considering Llama isn't a common name, I should take care not to misspell it or use lowercase unless instructed. Let me confirm the name and offer assistance. I'll keep it simple and welcoming.\n",

But the user wants a conversational tone, so perhaps a smiley. Let me structure the response as: \"Hello, Llama! 😊 Nice to meet you. How can I assist you today?\" That's friendly, uses their name correctly, and opens the door for help without assuming their intent.\n",
