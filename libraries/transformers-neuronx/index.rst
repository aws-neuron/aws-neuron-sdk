==============================================

.. important::
    As of 9/16/2025, support has ended for the Transformers NeuronX library and the corresponding documentation has been archived. If you are still using Transformers NeuronX, Neuron recommends that you migrate to the :ref:`NxD Inference library <nxdi-index>`, which provides a PyTorch-based inference library.  Refer to the :ref:`migration guide <nxdi_migrate_from_tnx>` to learn how to migrate your Transformers NeuronX workloads to NxD Inference.
