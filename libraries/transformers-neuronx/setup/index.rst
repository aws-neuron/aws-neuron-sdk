Transformers NeuronX Setup (``transformers-neuronx``)
====================================================

If you already have setup your environment to run PyTorch NeuronX, you just need to install Transformers NeuronX library using
the following instruction.

.. code-block::

   pip install transformers-neuronx --extra-index-url=https://pip.repos.neuron.amazonaws.com


If you are starting from scratch, Neuron Multi Framework DLAMI is recommended as it comes pre-installed with Transformers NeuronX virtual environment.
