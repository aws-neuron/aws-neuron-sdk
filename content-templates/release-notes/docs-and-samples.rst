Improvements and changes
------------------------

This section of the release notes covers improvements and changes out side of the AWS Neuron SDK components, including changes to the documentation site and other parts of the larger Neuron SDK product experience.

Release notes have changed!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We've heard your feedback on the Neuron documentation, and we're starting on a journey to improve them. Once early change is a richer structure for the release notes with a clearer presentation of the details you're looking for. It's a small thing, but we hope it helps you!

With that in mind, we'd love to get your feedback on this new format and on our documentation all-up. If you have 5 minutes and want to help us build and deliver better developer docs for you, `Take this survey <>`_.
