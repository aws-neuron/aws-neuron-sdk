Support announcements
---------------------

This section signals the official deprecation or end of support for specific features, tools, and APIs.

Deprecation announcements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

"Deprecation" is a notification that a feature, tool, or API will not be supported in the future. Plan accordingly!

* Starting from Neuron Release 2.24, The Hugging Face transformers NeuronX library is deprecated and in maintenance mode. ``transformers-neuronx`` releases will now only address critical security issues. In Neuron Release 2.26, Neuron will end support for transformers-neuronx. Current users of ``transformers-neuronx ``are advised to migrate to <NeuronX Distributed Inference `/libraries/nxd-inference/nxdi-overview.html#nxdi-overview`>_.
* . . .

End of support announcements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

"End of support" means that AWS Neuron no longer supports the feature, tool, or API indicated in the note as of this release.

* END OF SUPPORT ANNOUNCEMENT 1
