Welcome to AWS Neuron
=====================
  
.. meta::
   :description: Neuron SDK is powering AWS Inferentia and Trainium based instances, natively integrated into PyTorch and TensorFlow. Enabling you to quicky start with Amazon EC2, AWS Sagemaker, ECS and EKS.

AWS Neuron is the software development kit (SDK) used to run deep learning and generative AI workloads on `AWS Inferentia <https://aws.amazon.com/ai/machine-learning/inferentia/>`_ and `AWS Trainium <https://aws.amazon.com/ai/machine-learning/trainium/>`_ powered Amazon EC2 instances and UltraServers (`Inf1 <https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/inf1/>`_, `Inf2 <https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/inf2/>`_, `Trn1 <https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/trn1/>`_ , `Trn2 <https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/trn2/>`_ and `Trn2 UltraServer <https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/ultraservers/>`_). It includes a compiler, runtime, training and inference libraries, and profiling tools. Neuron supports customers in their end-to-end ML development lifecycle including building and deploying deep learning and AI models.

* **ML Frameworks and Libraries** - Neuron integrates with :ref:`PyTorch  <pytorch-neuronx-main>` and :ref:`JAX <jax-neuron-main>`, and offers :ref:`NxD Training <nxdt>` and :ref:`NxD Inference <nxdi-index>` PyTorch libraries for distributed workflows. It also supports :ref:`third party libraries <third-party-libraries>` such as Hugging Face Optimum Neuron, PyTorch Lightning, and AXLearn library for JAX model training.

* **Frontier Models Support**  - Neuron supports frontier models such as Llama3.3-70b and Llama Llama3.1-405b.

* **Developer Tools** - Neuron provides :ref:`health monitoring, observability <monitoring_tools>`, and :ref:`profiling tools <profiling-tools>` for AWS Inferentia and Trainium instances. It tracks hardware utilization, model execution metrics, and device information. The Neuron Profiler identifies performance bottlenecks. Neuron also integrates with :ref:`third-party  <third-party-tool-solutions>`  monitoring tools like Datadog and Weights and Biases.

* **Compute Kernels** - :ref:`Neuron Kernel Interface (NKI) <neuron-nki>` provides direct hardware access on AWS Trainium and Inferentia, enabling customer to write optimized kernel. NKI provides a Python-based environment with Triton-like syntax. Neuron supports custom C++ operators, allowing developers to extend functionality and enhance deep learning models.


* **Workloads Orchestrations and Managed Services**  - Neuron enables you to use Trainium and Inferentia-based instances with Amazon services such as SageMaker, EKS, ECS, ParallelCluster, and Batch. and :ref:`third-party solutions <third-party-devflow-solutions>` like Ray (Anyscale) and Domino Data Lab.


* **Architecture**  - To understand the architecture of AWS AI Chips, Trn/Inf instances, and NeuronCores visit :ref:`neuroninstances-arch`, :ref:`neurondevices-arch` and :ref:`neuroncores-arch`.
