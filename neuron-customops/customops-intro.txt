Neuron Custom C++ Operators enable developers to write C++ Custom Operators (“CustomOps”) that run on NeuronCores. This enables developers to extend operator support beyond what is officially supported by Neuron.

Developers can use standard PyTorch custom operators programming interfaces to leverage Neuron Custom C++ Operators feature. This makes it easy to migrate CPU Custom Operators to Neuron, and implement new beta operators, all without any intimate knowledge of the NeuronCore hardware.
