No.

How do I restart/start/stop the Neuron Runtime?

Since Neuron Runtime is a library, starting/stopping application would result in starting/stopping the Neuron Runtime.


How do I know which runtimes are associated with which Neuron Device(s)?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
`neuron-ls` and `neuron-top` can be used to find out applications using Neuron Devices.


What about RedHat or other versions of Linux and Windows?
--------------------------------------------------------

We don't officially support it yet.


How can I take advantage of multiple NeuronCores to run multipleinferences in parallel?
