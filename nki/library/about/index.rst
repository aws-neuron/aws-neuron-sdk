About the NKI Library 
======================================

Learn about the NKI Library and the pre-built kernels it provides to accelerate the performance of your models.

What is the NKI Library?
-----------------------------------

The NKI Library is a collection of pre-built NKI kernels optimized for AWS Neuron-powered devices. These kernels are designed to accelerate machine learning workloads by providing efficient implementations of common operations used in deep learning models. 

How do I use the NKI Library?
------------------------------

The kernels in the NKI Library are provided in a public GitHub repository that you can clone and integrate into your Neuron-based model development workflow. You can use these kernels directly in your models to take advantage of their optimized performance on Neuron hardware. 

* **NKI Library repository**: https://github.com/aws-neuron/nki-library

To get started using NKI Library kernels in your model development, clone or fork the repo and follow the instructions in the `README <https://github.com/aws-neuron/nki-library/blob/main/README.md>`_ file.
