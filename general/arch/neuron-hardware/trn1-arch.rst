AWS Trn1/Trn1n Architecture
===========================

In this page, we provide an architectural overview of the AWS Trn1/Trn1n
instances, and the corresponding :ref:`Trainium <trainium-arch>` NeuronDevices that power them
(Trainium devices from here on).

Trn1/Trn1n Architecture
-----------------------

The EC2 Trn1/Trn1n instance is powered by up to 16 :ref:`Trainium <trainium-arch>` devices.

The Trn1.2xlarge instance size allows customers to train their models on
a single Trainium device, which is useful for small model training, as
well as model experimentation. The Trn1.32xlarge/ Trn1n.32xlarge instance size comes
with a high-bandwidth and low-latency NeuronLink-v2 device-to-device
interconnect, which utilizes a 4D-HyperCube topology. This is useful for
collective-communication between the Trainium devices during scale-out
training, as well as for pooling the memory capacity of all Trainium
devices, making it directly addressable from each one of the devices.

In a Trn1/Trn1n server, the Trainium devices are connected in a 2D Torus topology, as depicted below:

The Trn1/Trn1n instances are also available in an EC2 UltraCluster, which
enables customers to scale Trn1/Trn1n instances to over 30,000 Trainium
devices, and leverage the AWS-designed non-blocking petabit-scale EFA
networking infrastructure.
