Neuron Architecture
===================

The Neuron Architecture provides insights into Neuron enabled instances system, software and chip capabilities. The EC2 Trn and Inf instance architecture provides an overview of the EC2 instances powered by the Inferentia and Trainium chips (Neuron Devices), and the corresponding system features like inbox and network connectivity, memory hierarchy, and NeuronCores versions and capabilities. The Neuron model architecture fit provides insights to what is the best match between deep-learning model architectures and the NeuronCore version.
