Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Collective Communications is an integral component of distributed ML
training. Multiple training nodes exchange information during ML
training via Collective Communication operators such as all-reduce.
Neuron provides hardware support for the execution of Collective
Communication with the Neuron SDK responsible for the hardware
configuration and for the execution orchestration. Neuron provides the
following Collective Communication operators:

-  all-reduce
-  all-gather
-  reduce-scatter

Neuron also provides the following peer to peer operators:

-  send
-  receive

Support for additional Collective Communication operators might be added
in future releases. Neuron devices are connected via NeuronLinks within
a single instance and EFA links between instances. All NeuronLinks
transfer the data directly between Neuron device and between Neuron
devices and EFA devices bypassing the host to achieve high bandwidth and
low latency.


Collective Communication support on Neuron requires installation of 3
separate packages:

-  ``aws-neuronx-runtime-lib`` - supports execution on Neuron, not
   specific to Collective Communication and is always required
-  ``aws-neuronx-collectives`` - supports Collective Communication
   execution on a single instance and on multiple instances.
-  ``efa_installer`` - low level libraries and drivers to support
   Collective Communication execution over EFA, required to support
   Collective Communication on multiple instances.

ML models need to be compiled by the Neuron compiler before they can be
executed on Neuron devices. The result of the compilation is a binary
object containing computational instruction and data movement
instructions. Any Collective Communication operators encountered during
compilation are converted to the place holder instructions to be filled
by the runtime/collectives libraries during load and execution. This
approach allows Neuron compiler to be unaware of the specific physical
topology connecting Neuron devices. Once a compiled mode is placed on
Neuron devices the runtime/collectives libraries generate the
appropriate data movement instructions based on the placement. For
example, a different set of instructions is generated when the next rank
is connected via NeuronLinks or via EFA. Neuron executes Collective
Communication operators using dedicated hardware that is not shared with
computational resources. That allows Neuron to execute compute and
communication in parallel. For example Neuron can all-reduce gradients
of one layer while the gradients for another layer are computed.
Overlapping compute and communication can result is lower latency and
higher performance.



.. _trn132xlarge-topology:

trn1.32xlarge topology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



.. image:: /images/trn1-topology.png

**Trn1.32xl 2D torus topology**

On a single trn1.32xlarge instance Neuron devices are connected in a 2D
torus topology supporting Collective Communication operators in sets of
2, 8 and 32 ranks. Other set sizes might be supported in future
releases. A single instance topology can be further extended across
multiple instances using EFA NeuronLinks.

For example an 8x4 topology on a single instance, such as 8 rank tensor
parallel and 4 ranks data parallel can be extended across multiple
instances creating a large tensor/data parallel training cluster.

.. _trn12xlarge-topology:

trn1.2xlarge topology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Trn1.2xlarge instance type contains a single Neuron device with two
NeuronCores. This instance type supports only 2 ranks Collective
Communication operators. EFA is not available on trn1.2xlarge and the
ranks cannot be extended beyond a single instance.

.. _inf248xlarge-topology:

inf2.48xlarge topology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: /images/inf248xl-topology.png

**inf2.48xlarge topology**

On inf2.48xlarge instance Neuron devices are connected in a ring via 
NeuronLink. Any **even** number of ranks for Collective
Communication operators is supported provided that the ranks occupy 
consecutive Neuron devices. However, when using any number of ranks 
other than 24 (full instance) full performance of the ring is not utilized.

Inf2 other instance sizes topologies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: /images/inf224xl-topology.png

**inf2 other instance sizes topologies**

On other inf2 instance sizes Neuron devices are connected bi-directionally.
Any **even** number of ranks for Collective Communication operators is
supported provided that the ranks occupy consecutive Neuron devices.
Collective Communication performance is similar to the performance on
inf2.48xlarge when fewer than 24 ranks are used.
