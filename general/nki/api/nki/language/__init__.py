def affine_range(*args):
  r"""
  Create a sequence of numbers for use as **parallel** loop iterators in NKI. ``affine_range`` should be the default
  loop iterator choice, when there is **no** loop carried dependency. Note, associative reductions are **not** considered
  loop carried dependencies in this context. A concrete example of associative reduction
  is multiple :doc:`nl.matmul <nki.language.matmul>`
  or :doc:`nisa.nc_matmul <nki.isa.nc_matmul>` calls accumulating into the same
  output buffer defined outside of this loop level (see code example #2 below).

  When the above conditions are not met, we recommend using :doc:`sequential_range <nki.language.sequential_range>`
  instead.

  Notes:

  - Using ``affine_range`` prevents Neuron compiler from unrolling the loops until entering compiler backend,
    which typically results in better compilation time compared to the fully unrolled iterator
    :doc:`static_range <nki.language.static_range>`.
  - Using ``affine_range`` also allows Neuron compiler to perform additional loop-level optimizations, such as
    loop vectorization in current release. The exact type of loop-level optimizations applied is subject
    to changes in future releases.

def sequential_range(*args):
  r"""
  Create a sequence of numbers for use as **sequential** loop iterators in NKI. ``sequential_range``
  should be used when there is a loop carried dependency. Note, associative reductions are **not** considered
  loop carried dependencies in this context. See :doc:`affine_range <nki.language.affine_range>` for
  an example of such associative reduction.

  Notes:

  - Inside a NKI kernel, any use of Python ``range(...)`` will be replaced with ``sequential_range(...)``
    by Neuron compiler.
  - Using ``sequential_range`` prevents Neuron compiler from unrolling the loops until entering compiler backend,
    which typically results in better compilation time compared to the fully unrolled iterator
    :doc:`static_range <nki.language.static_range>`.
  - Using ``sequential_range`` informs Neuron compiler to respect inter-loop dependency and perform
    much more conservative loop-level optimizations compared to ``affine_range``.
  - Using ``affine_range`` instead of ``sequential_range`` in case of loop carried dependency
    incorrectly is considered unsafe and could lead to numerical errors.
