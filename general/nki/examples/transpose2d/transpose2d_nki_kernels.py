def tensor_transpose2D_kernel_(in_tensor, out_tensor, shape2D):
  """
  NKI kernel to reorder the elements on axis[1] of the input tensor.

  Every row of the input tensor is a flattened row-major 2D matrix.
  The shape2D argument defines the dimensions of the flattened matrices (#rows,#cols).
  Our goal in this kernel is to transpose these flattened 2D matrices, i.e. make them (#cols,#rows).

  Example:
      in_tensor = [a0,a1,a2,a3,b0,b1,b2,b3,c0,c1,c2,c3]
      shape2D = (3,4)
  this means that in_tensor has 3 rows and 4 columns, i.e. can be represented as:
      [a0,a1,a2,a3]
      [b0,b1,b2,b3]
      [c0,c1,c2,c3]
  after transpose, we expect to get:
      [a0,b0,c0]
      [a1,b1,c1]
      [a2,b2,c2]
      [a3,b3,c3]
  Thus, out_tensor is expected to be [a0,b0,c0,a1,b1,c1,a2,b2,c2,a3,b3,c3]

  Args:
    in_tensor: an input tensor
    shape2D: tuple representing the dimensions to be transposed: (#rows, #cols)
    out_tensor: an output (transposed) tensor
