RMSNorm
=============

In this tutorial, we implement a kernel to perform RMSNorm of a **2D tensor**,
as described in `Root Mean Square Layer Normalization <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.07467v1.pdf>`__.
In doing so, we learn about:

- The NKI syntax and programming model
- Broadcasting tensors in different axis
- Mapping embarrassingly parallel vector operations efficiently to the NeuronCore
- Disable ineffectual data movement or compute within a tile using an execution mask

Before diving into RMSNorm of 2D input, let's go over the RMSNorm operator for a
**1D vector** ``a`` defined as below:

.. math::
    \bar{a_i} = \frac{a_i}{\text{RMS}(a)}g_i,\text{ where RMS}(a) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^n{a_i^2}}


Note, ``g`` is the RMSNorm weight, which has the same shape as the input vector ``a``.
The function RMS(a) produces a single scalar element, and we divide every element
in the input vector ``a`` by the ``RMS(a)`` scalar (i.e., a broadcast divide).

In Transformer models, we typically perform RMSNorm on a 2D input tensor instead
(with shape ``[sequence length, embedding size]``). 2D-RMSNorm simply performs 1D-RMSNorm
as discussed above for *every row* of the input 2D tensor. The ``g`` RMSNorm weight vector
is shared (i.e., broadcasted) across the rows for the multiplication.
:ref:`Figure <nki-fig-rmsnorm>` below visualizes
the tensor shapes involved in 2D-RMSNorm, where `a_tensor` is the 2D input tensor and
`g_tensor` is the 1D RMSNorm weight:

   RMSNorm tensor shapes


We are going to map the rows (``a_tensor.shape[0]``) to the partition dimension of the SBUF
once we load the tensor from HBM. This is a natural layout choice since each SBUF partition
has a one-to-one mapping to a parallel vector lane in the compute engines for calculating
``RMS(a_tensor)``.

Note, the division of ``RMS(a_tensor)`` requires broadcasting of one scalar across all elements
of ``a_tensor`` within each partition, which is considered a free-axis broadcast and supported
by the flexible memory access pattern in hardware. On the other hand, the multiplication
with g_tensor requires broadcasting of a vector across all partitions, which is considered
a partition-axis broadcast and must invoke another instruction for the broadcasting
(``broadcast_to()`` API, details see below implementation) .

Compute kernel
--------------

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/rmsnorm/rmsnorm_nki_kernels.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:
   :lines: 9-69

In this example, we implement RMSNorm for a 2D input tensor in ``nki_rmsnorm_kernel``:

* We assume each SBUF partition is large enough to fit at least one row of ``a_tensor``
  and one copy of ``g_tensor`` simultaneously.
* We load ``g_tensor`` once into the SBUF outside the main loop that iterates over tiles of
  ``a_tensor`` to achieve maximum reuse. The g_tensor is reshaped into a 2D tensor because
  SBUF is a two-dimensional memory and hence expects at least two dimension for any SBUF tensor.
  A reshape of an HBM tensor without changing the underlying storage format is in fact a
  no-op with no performance cost in the final compiled executable.
* To adhere to NKI's tile-size considerations (:ref:`Tile Size Considerations <nki-tile-size>`),
  we limit the partition axis size of ``g_tensor`` tile to be 128.
* The trip count of the compute loop is ``math.ceil(a_tensor.shape[0]/128)``.
  In cases where ``a_tensor.shape[0]`` is not a multiple of 128, we can disable
  ineffectual data movement or compute in the last iteration using the ``mask`` field
  (discussions below).
* Within the compute loop:

    * We load one tile of ``g_tensor`` with shape ``(128, g_tensor.shape[1])``
      using ``nl.load`` API. We guard the loading boundary by specifying
      ``mask=(i * 128 + ix < num_rows)``, which ensures we don't access out-of-bound
      memory when the number of rows in ``a_tensor`` is not a multiple of 128.
    * We perform the free-axis broadcast multiply (``division of RMS(a)``) using
      ``nl.multiply(a_tile, rms_reciprocal)``, which is lowered into
      :doc:`nki.isa.tensor_scalar <../api/generated/nki.isa.tensor_scalar>`
      instruction under the hood.
    * To broadcast multiply with the RMSNorm weight g_tensor, we need to
      perform a partition-axis broadcast of the g_tensor. The number of partitions
      to broadcast to depends on how many active rows are being normalized in the
      current loop iteration: ``min(num_rows - i * 128, 128)``. Next, we can do
      element-wise multiplication of the broadcasted ``g_tensor`` and the intermediate
      normalized tile ``out_tile``, which is lowered into
      :doc:`nki.isa.tensor_tensor <../api/generated/nki.isa.tensor_tensor>`
      instruction under the hood.
    * Finally, we store the normalized tile back into HBM using the
      :doc:`nl.store <../api/generated/nki.language.store>` API.
      We guard the store boundary similar to load boundary using the ``mask`` field.
