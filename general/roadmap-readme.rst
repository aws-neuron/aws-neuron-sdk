Roadmap
=======

The AWS Neuron feature roadmap provides visibility onto what we are
working on in terms of functional and performance in the near future. We
hope this will help you better plan how to use Neuron with your
products. Weâ€™d love to get our customers feedback as well, to help us
ensure we are working on the most important requests.
