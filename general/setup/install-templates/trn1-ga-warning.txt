.. important::

    AutoScalingGroups is currently not supported on Trn1 and will be added soon.
    
    To launch a Trn1 cluster you can use AWS ParallelCluster, please see `example <https://github.com/aws-neuron/aws-neuron-parallelcluster-samples>`_.

.. note::

  Neuron Driver installed on Deep Learning AMI (DLAMI) with Conda does not support Trn1.
  
  If you want to use DLAMI with Conda, please make sure to uninstall ``aws-neuron-dkms`` and install 
  ``aws-neuronx-dkms`` before using  Neuron on DLAMI with Conda.
