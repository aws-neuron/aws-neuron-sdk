The simplest environment setup for model development installs all Neuron SDK components
directly on an AWS ML accelerator instance: the Neuron framework extensions, compiler, runtime, and tools. This will
allow you to compile, execute, and performance tune your model, all in the same instance. This is the recommended
workflow when first starting to work with Neuron device or when optimizing a model.

Note:
If you are using a regular U18, U20, or AL2 AMI, follow the same setup instructions as the Base DLAMIs respectively.
