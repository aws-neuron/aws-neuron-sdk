During deployment it can be beneficial to reduce the number of components installed in the system.
For use-cases where only inference is necessary (compilation is already complete), only the
framework and runtime should be installed.

Note:
If you are using a regular U18, U20, or AL2 AMI, follow the same setup instructions as the Base DLAMIs respectively.
