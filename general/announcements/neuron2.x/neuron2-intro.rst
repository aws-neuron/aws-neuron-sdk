Introducing first release of Neuron 2.x enabling EC2 Trn1 general availability (GA)
===================================================================================

:ref:`Neuron release 2.3 <neuron2x-trn1ga>` is the first release of Neuron 2.x, and which enables GA of the new EC2 Trn1 instances.
Neuron release 2.3 extends latest release of Neuron 1.x (Neuron 1.19.2) to add support for deep-learning training on the AWS Trainium chips.

Starting with :ref:`Neuron release 2.3 <neuron2x-trn1ga>`, developers can run deep learning training workloads on Trn1 instances to save training costs by up to 
50% over equivalent GPU-based EC2 instances, while getting the highest training performance in AWS cloud for popular NLP models.  Neuron 2.x introduces the new capabilities and major architectural updates to support training neural-networks with the Trn1 instances. 


In addition, starting with this release, Neuron introduces new packages, renames several packages, 
and updates Neuron installation and update instructions.  This release also ends the support for Neuron Runtime 1.x.
