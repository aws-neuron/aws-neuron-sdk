Announcing end of support for Transformers NeuronX library starting in Neuron 2.26 release
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Starting from :ref:`Neuron Release 2.24 <neuron-2.24.0-whatsnew>`, Transformers NeuronX library is in maintenance mode. ``transformers-neuronx`` releases will now only address critical security issues. In Neuron Release 2.26, Neuron will end support for ``transformers-neuronx``.

Current users of ``transformers-neuronx`` are advised to migrate to :ref:`NeuronX Distributed Inference <nxdi-overview>`.
