Tensorflow-Neuron 1.x enters maintenance mode
-----------------------------------------------

Starting with :ref:`Neuron release 2.18 <neuron-2.18.0-whatsnew>`, Tensorflow-Neuron 1.x is entering maintenance mode. Future releases of Tensorflow-Neuron 1.x will address critical security issues only and we will gradually end support. Current users of those versions are advised to migrate to latest tensorflow-neuron version 2.10.1.
