Neuron support for MxNet enters maintenance mode
---------------------------------------------------

Starting with :ref:`Neuron release 2.19 <neuron-2.19.0-whatsnew>`, Neuron support for MxNet (``mxnet-neuron``) is entering maintenance mode.

Future releases of ``mxnet-neuron`` will address critical security issues only and we will gradually end support. Current users of ``mxnet-neuron`` are advised to migrate to PyTorch NeuronX or TensorFlow NeuronX.
