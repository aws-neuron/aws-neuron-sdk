Announcing end of support for NxDT Megatron Models starting next release
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

:ref:`Neuron release 2.23 <neuron-2.23.0-whatsnew>` will be the last release to include support for NxDT Megatron Models.

Customers currently using NxDT Megatron Models will need to transition to using Hugging Face (HF) models. Current Megatron models will continue to function, but will not receive updates or bug fixes starting from Neuron Release 2.24 and onwards.

We recommend all users of NxDT Megatron Models to transition to Hugging Face (HF) models. For detailed migration guidance, please refer to our comprehensive :ref:`migration guide <placeholder-migration-guide-megatron-to-hf>`.
