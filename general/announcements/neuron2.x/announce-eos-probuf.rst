Announcing end of support for Probuf versions <= 3.19 for PyTorch NeuronX, NeuronX Distributed, and Transformers NeuronX libraries 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

:ref:`Neuron release 2.19 <neuron-2.19.0-whatsnew>` will be the last release that will include Probuf <= 3.19 support for PyTorch NeuronX, NeuronX Distributed, and Transformers NeuronX libraries. Future Neuron releases will not include Probuf <= 3.19 support for PyTorch NeuronX.

Current PyTorch NeuronX, NeuronX Distributed, or Transformers NeuronX users using Probuf <= 3.19 are advised to migrate to latest supported Probuf version.
