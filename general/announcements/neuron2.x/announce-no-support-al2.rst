Neuron Runtime no longer supports Amazon Linux 2 (AL2)
========================================================

Starting from :ref:`Neuron release 2.20 <neuron-2.20.0-whatsnew>`, the Neuron Runtime (``aws-neuronx-runtime-lib``) will no longer support Amazon Linux 2 (AL2). The Neuron Driver (``aws-neuronx-dkms``) is now the only Neuron package that supports Amazon Linux 2.

This change introduces the following constraint:

Customers cannot run their full Neuron-powered applications natively on an AL2-based Amazon Machine Image (AMI). To leverage Neuron functionality on an AL2 AMI, customers must containerize their applications using a Neuron supported container with non-AL2 Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu 22.04, Amazon Linux 2023, etc.) and then deploy those containers on an AL2-based AMI that has the Neuron Driver (``aws-neuronx-dkms``) installed.

How does this impact me?
------------------------

**I have an AL2 DLAMI**

If you are using one of the following Amazon
Linux 2 DLAMIs, please migrate to a supported DLAMI (e.g., Ubuntu 22.04, Amazon Linux 2023 (AL2023), etc.). Please see :ref:`neuron-dlami-overview` for
a list of all supported DLAMIs to migrate to.

+-----------------+------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
|    Framework    | Operating System |                        DLAMI Name                         |
+=================+==================+===========================================================+
|  PyTorch 1.13   |  Amazon Linux 2  |  Deep Learning AMI Neuron PyTorch 1.13 (Amazon Linux 2)   |
+-----------------+------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| TensorFlow 2.10 |  Amazon Linux 2  | Deep Learning AMI Neuron TensorFlow 2.10 (Amazon Linux 2) |
+-----------------+------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+

**I am using my own AL2 Container**

If you using your own AL2 Container, please migrate to a Neuron supported container with non-AL2 Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu 22.04, Amazon Linux 2023, etc.)

**I am using a base AL2 DLAMI**

If you are using a base Amazon Linux 2 DLAMI, please ensure the Neuron Driver (``aws-neuronx-dkms``) is the only Neuron package installed. Please use non AL2 (e.g., Ubuntu 22.04, Amazon Linux 2023, etc.) containers to run your Neuron applications.

.. note::
   Neuron does not supports Linux kernel versions < 5.10. Customers using
   Linux kernel versions < 5.10 must migrate to >= 5.10. To see
   Linux kernel versions supported by the Neuron Driver, see :ref:`latest-neuron-release-artifacts`.
