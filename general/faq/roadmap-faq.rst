Why did you build this?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A: We know that our customers are making decisions and plans based on
what we are developing, and we want to provide them with the right
visibility to what we are working on, as well as the opportunity to
provide direct feedback.

What do the roadmap categories mean?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Roadmap Requests** - Requests we received and we are considering to add to the roadmap, 
   this is a great phase to give us feedback and let us know if you need this feature as well.
-  **Working on it** - In progress, we might still be
   working through the implementation details, or scoping stuff out.
   This is a great phase to give us feedback as to how you want to see
   something implemented. We’ll benefit from your specific use cases
   here.
-  **Completed** - Feature complete and supported by Neuron.


Why are there no dates on your roadmap?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A: We are not providing exact target dates for releases because we
prioritize operational excellence, security and quality over hitting a
specific date. If you have an urgent need for a feature, please contact
us directly at aws-neuron-support@amazon.com.

Is everything on the roadmap?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A: We are focusing on upgrades for existing features, as well as
building new features. We will keep adding features and capabilities to
this roadmap as time progresses.

How can I provide feedback or ask for more information?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A: When in doubt, please create an issue or post a question on the `AWS
Neuron support
forum <https://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=355>`__.

How can I request a feature be added to the roadmap?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A: We encourage you to open an issue. All community-submitted issues
will be reviewed by the roadmap maintainers.

Can I "+1" existing issues?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A:We strongly encourage you to do so, as it helps us understand which
issues will have the widest impact. You can navigate to the issue
details page and add a reaction (thumbs up). There are six types of
reactions supported (thumbs down “-1”, confused, heart, watching, laugh,
hooray, and thumbs up +1).
