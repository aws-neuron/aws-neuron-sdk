# AWS Neuron  

## Neuron SDK Overview

AWS Neuron is a software development kit (SDK) enabling high-performance deep learning acceleration using AWS Inferentia and Trainium, AWS's custom designed machine learning accelerators. With Neuron, you can develop, profile, and deploy high-performance machine learning workloads on top of accelerated EC2 instances, e.g. Inf1 and Trn1.

Neuron includes a compiler, runtime driver, as well as debug and profiling utilities with a TensorBoard plugin for visualization, and is pre-integrated into popular machine learning frameworks like Pytorch, TensorFlow and MXNet, to provide a seamless machine learning acceleration workflow.
