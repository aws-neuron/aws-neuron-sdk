# AWS Neuron  

## Neuron SDK Overview

AWS Neuron is a software development kit (SDK) enabling high-performance deep learning inference using AWS Inferentia custom designed machine learning chips. With Neuron, you can develop, profile, and deploy high-performance inference predictions on top of Inferentia based EC2
Inf1 instances.

Neuron is pre-integrated into popular machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow, MXNet and Pytorch to provide a seamless training-to-inference workflow. It includes a compiler, runtime driver, as well as debug and profiling utilities with a TensorBoard plugin for visualization.
